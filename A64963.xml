            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'Tis therefore a bad World, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſeems to be Exiled and Baniſhed out of it.

            <p>That thus it may be, is the end, both of this Book, and of its Author.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:44406:4"/> well to their Conſciences, and be ſo ſelf-denying, as to lay aſide their Paſſions and their Intereſts: This would be one of the moſt probable means to bring all to a better Agreement. They are the Carnal and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical of every Party, who endeavour to make breaches wider, that are the Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Diſputers.

               <salute>Conſcience,</salute>

            <p>MY Expectation is greater from Thee, than from any thing in the Reader beſides. I make no queſtion, but what I have written being oppoſite unto the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and corrupt Inclinations of men, will alſo be diſpleaſing to their Humour; but I have hope that Thou wilt ſide with me. 'Tis eaſie to convince Thee, that Sin is to the prejudice of the whole Man; that a Redeemer is to be prized by Sinners who are under the worſt kind of Bondage; and that Holineſs is for men's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Intereſt, and Safety. 'Tis eaſie to convince Thee, that thoſe Pleaſures and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which are offer'd in Temptation, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, and that 'tis the heighth of Folly to yield unto the Tempter, to forſake an All-ſufficient
<pb facs="tcp:44406:5"/> God, to hazard an immortal Soul, and venture the enduring of Eternal Miſery, for the ſake of thoſe Profits and Delights which are ſo mixed and unſatisfactory while enjoyed; and which can continue at longeſt but a very ſhort ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>And ſince it is moſt certainly thus, <hi>O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> keep not ſilence, produce the Word of God, and there ſhew how the Lord has given thee a Negative Voice, and allows nothing to be done that may defile or wound thee. Proteſt loudly and peremptorily againſt all Sin, call Heaven and Earth to witneſs, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto thine aſſiſtance; Vigorouſly oppoſe the Enemy of Mankind, who hath his Name <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon,</hi> becauſe he endeavours to deſtroy all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre thy ſelf, and joyn with Me in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to hinder the everlaſting Ruine of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader who ſhall take this Book into his hand.</p>
            <p>My deſign is not to turn People to a Party, but to turn them unto God; that which I preach up is Faith in our Lord Jeſus, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Heart and Converſation: And ſurely ſuch a deſign Thou canſt not but approve; ſuch a Doctrine Thou muſt needs grant is faithful, ſound, and conſequently worthy of all Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Conſcience,</hi> I am pleading for God! that He who is ſo Great and Good may be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:44406:5"/> and that the Sons of Men would ſubmit their Wills to His: And this is a thing but very equal, ſince their Wills are corrupt and fooliſh, and ſtrongly inclin'd unto what is miſchievous to themſelves; but His is wiſe and gracious, and never commands any thing but what is really for the Profit of him that is to yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>I am likewiſe, <hi>O Conſcience,</hi> pleading for Thee, that Thou mayſt be allowed the free Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thy Authority and Power; and mayeſt be hearkened to whenever thou doſt declaim againſt Sin, and urge unto thoſe Duties which the Lord requires. The deſign of this Book is, that Thou mayſt be more fully enlightned; that thou mayſt be more pure and peaceable; that thoſe wounds which Sin has made in thee may be healed; and that wounds which are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable may for the future be prevented; and above all that thou mayſt not be forced to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Thy ſelf and any Reader for ever in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Conſcience,</hi> next unto the Spirits gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and powerfull Concurrence, (which with my whole Soul I do implore) the Succeſs of this Treatiſe will very much depend upon Thy Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in doing of thy Office. Bid the Reader mind what he reads, apply to himſelf what he minds, practice what he applyes; and having begun to practiſe, never grow weary of well-doing.

            <p>IN the foregoing Chapter the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares at large unto the Jews, the miraculous manner of his converſion to the Chriſtian Faith: and being thus converted, he was very forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate that Faith which once he endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. He tells them plainly, that in oppoſing Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he had been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a fighter againſt God himſelf;</hi> and that the Stone which heretofore he had ſtumbled at, is that chief Corner-ſtone which is laid in <hi>Zion</hi> for a Foundation; on which whoever builds, his building ſhall never fall. This he perceived evidently in his way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> as he was journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Authority and Commiſſion to perſecute the Chriſtians; Chriſt himſelf both meets and ſtops him. at <hi>Mid-day he ſaw a Light from Heaven above the</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44406:10"/> 
               <hi>Brightneſs of the Sun;</hi> which did both ſtrike him Blind with its exceſſive Shining, and yet alſo opened his Eyes, to behold his former Errour, in ſetting himſelf againſt the Lord of Life and Glory.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this Relation was to convince the Jewes, and to perſwade them to embrace that Jeſus who was crucified indeed, that he might redeem them from the curſe, which they could never eſcape by any other means; but liveth by the power of God, and is exalted far above all Heavens that he might fill all things.</p>
            <p>Well; They hear the Apoſtle with patience, untill he told them of his Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles; and then a moſt Satanical Envy and Fury ſtops their Ears, and they cry out; <hi>Away with ſuch a Fellow from the Earth.</hi> And truly from the Earth they had quickly ſent him, if the chief Captain <hi>Lyſias,</hi> underſtanding that he was a Roman (that is; though a Jew by birth, yet having the priviledge of a Roman Citizen) <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            <p>Being thus delivered from the multitude, he is brought and ſet before the Councel. He ſtands alone indeed to make his defence; but as the Lord ſtood by him to ſtrengthen him, ſo he brings with him a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which was as much, nay, more to make him undaunted, then if he had had a thouſand witneſſes of his innocency. <hi>And</hi> Paul <hi>earneſtly beholding the Councel, ſaid, Men and Brethren, I have lived in all good Conſcience before God unto this day.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>He had acted as before God;</hi> and had good Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that God approved of what he had done: he had cauſe to be confident, that the Supream and Moſt Righteous Judge would not condemn him; but was pleaſed at that, for which the Jews were ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. <hi>Chriſoſt.</hi> obſerves <note n="(b)" place="margin">

            <p>I ſhall obſerve from the Text, ſeveral points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God has placed a Conſcience in Man.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had a Conſcience and 'twas a good Conſcience, all others have a Conſcience likewiſe either good or evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To have a good conſcience ſhould be every ones greatest care.</hi> Every one ſhould ſtrive to reſemble the Apoſtle, and be able to ſay, I have lived in good Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A good Conſcience will make men to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as before God continually.</hi> I have lived in good Conſcience before God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A good Conſcience has a great and laſting influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Life and all the Actions.</hi> I have <hi>lived</hi> in <hi>all</hi> good Conſcience, and that <hi>unto this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>A good Conſcience makes a Man fearleſs, and and ſteels his Heart with courage, when he ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Enemies. Paul</hi> earneſtly beheld the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Thoſe who are truly Conſcientious, love their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and wiſh them no worſe then if they were their brethren. Paul</hi> ſaid, Men and Brethren:</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>God has placed a Conſcience in Man.</hi> Such a thing as Conſcience is ſuppoſed in the Text, elſe 'twere not capable of being good or bad. To have a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44406:11"/> Conſcience is common to all; though to have a good one, as the Apoſtle had, is very rare.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall undertake three things. Firſt I ſhall prove that there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Man. Secondly, I ſhall tell you what this Conſcience is. Thirdly, I ſhall aſſign the Reaſons why the Lord hath given unto Man a Conſcience. After theſe three things are diſpatched, will follow the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place I am to prove, <hi>That there is a Conſcience in Man</hi> There is great need that this ſhould be made evident, becauſe <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ita in multorum animis extincta eſt conſcientia, ut licet interdum tacitos ejuſdem ſtimulos ſentiant; tamen quae de eâ audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant pro ludibrio habeant; ac ſi figmentum, ſomnium &amp; inane</hi>

               </gap> a meer Bug-bear, to fright thoſe who are timorous; then if it were a dream or phancy. But as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the fool ſayes in <hi>his Heart there is no God, Pſ.</hi> 14. 1. tis not becauſe there is no God indeed: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being afraid of God, he wiſhes there were none at all. So the true cauſe why ſtupid ſinners ſay there is no ſuch thing as Conſcience, is this, Conſcience does accuſe, and reproach, and diſquiet them, and they firſt wiſhing there were no ſuch thing, employ their corrupt reaſon to argue againſt it. But I ſhall prove that there is really a Conſcience in Man three wayes. Firſt, By the Light of Nature. Secondly, By Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And laſtly, By Experience.</p>
            <p>1. That there is ſuch a thing as Conſcience is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>By the Light of Nature.</hi> Though there is a further light which ſhines from the Word of God, yet the light of Nature is much to be regarded: for thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44406:12"/> Truths are of very great importance and uſe, that by this light are made manifeſt. <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Praemiſit Deus Naturam Magiſtrum, ſubmiſſurus propheli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ut facilius credas prophetiae, diſcipulus naturae.</hi> Tertul.</note> The light of Nature informs us of an <hi>eternal Power and God-Head, Rom.</hi> 1. 20. The ſame light alſo tells us of a Conſcience, which is ever with us, always obſerves us, and unto whoſe Power and Authority we ought to ſubmit our ſolves. The Apoſtle ſpeaks fully to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. 15. <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing them Witneſſe, and their Thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Law written in the Hearts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> They were not altogether unacquainted with the duties of the firſt Table; but knew that as there is a God, ſo this God is to be loved, pleaſed, praiſed, ſerved; and that there ſhould be a truſting in him; that he ſhould be Worſhipped with a pure mind. 'Twas the ſaying of <hi>Cato.</hi> 
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Si Deus eſt animus, nobis ut carmina dicunt, Hic tibi praecipuè ſit purâ mente colendus,</hi> Cato De moribus, lib. 1. diſt. 1.</note> 
               <hi>If God be a Spirit then with a pure mind chiefly he is to be Worſhipped.</hi> But as to the ſecond Table of the Law, they were more fully inſtructed concerning the duties therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. They knew that Parents were to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Murther was to be abhorred, that Adultery was not to be committed, that Theft was a ſin to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, that they were not to bear falſe Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, nor to Covet what belonged to them. Now by this Law in their Hearts, the Conſciences of the Heathens were informed, and obliged; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44406:12"/> they were able to diſcern the difference between Good and Evil. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes, that <note n="(f)" place="margin">

               <hi>there is a ſenſe of good even in thoſe minds that are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unto the Commiſſion of the greateſt Evils, neither are they ignorant what is abominable, but neglect what they underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Conſciences of the Heathens did bear them witneſſe,</hi> in this reſpect the <hi>Lord may be ſaid not to have left himſelf without a witneſs,</hi> even in them to whom his written Word never came. The Gentiles took notice of ſomething within themſelves, which as it did urge them to what was good, and endeavoured to reſtrain them from evil, ſo it took notice of all they did, and was ready to witneſs for them or againſt them, according as the Law written in their Hearts was obſerved or tranſgreſſed. 'Tis a notable injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">(g)<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Above all others reverence thy ſelf,</hi> that is; chiefly regard Conſcience the witneſs within thee, and be afraid and aſhamed to do any thing before this witneſſe, which may be matter of juſt accuſation againſt thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Thoughts of the Gentiles did accuſe them upon their doing Evil.</hi> Theſe accuſations were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with great Torment; and this torment was the more tormenting becauſe Conſcience could not be avoided, but guilty ſinners were forced to hear the diſquieting reproaches of it. The Fable concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tityus,</hi> who after he attempted to Raviſh <hi>Latona,</hi> was adjudged to have a Vulture to feed upon his Liver, which grew with the Moon, and conſequently was

The Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which the Poets talk of, are the torments of an accuſing Conſcience; and ſuch kind of puniſhments are a great deal worſe than the ſevereſt judge on Earth is able to inflict, <hi>Juvenal, Satyr.</hi> 13. ſpeaks notably to this purpoſe.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Thoughts of the Gentiles did excuſe them, upon well doing.</hi> They found a great ſatisfaction, in going according to the dictates of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and this tended very much to their ſupport <note n="(h)" place="margin">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44406:13"/> Adverſity it ſelf was ſweetned, when Conſcience gave them its approbation. <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks excellently <note n="(i)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Illud vero eſt hominis magni &amp; ſapientis, libidinem, odium, invidiam, metum, cupiditateſque omnes amovere; maximéque, aeſtimare conſcientiam mentis ſuae, quam ab Diis immortalibus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepimus, quae à nobis divelli non poteſt.

Cluentio.</note> 
               <hi>That is the part of one that would be Great and Wiſe, to put away Luſt, and Hatred, and Envy, and Fear, and all carnal Affections; and moſt of all to mind his Conſcience. This we have received from God, &amp; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from us. And if this be a witneſſe to us, that we follow and practiſe the beſt Counſel, our Life will be without Fear, and with the greateſt Honeſty.</hi> You ſee what contentment and peace did enſue, when the Heathens made it their care not to go contrary to the light in their own minds. And though I dare not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, becauſe Conſcience did excuſe them, that God did juſtifie them, (for there is no way of being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, that is revealed to us, but by Faith in our Lord Jeſus) yet 'tis not at all diſagreeable to Truth, to ſay that the ſatisfaction which they had, was ſome reward of their well-doing, and a very great encouragement thereunto. Thus it appears <hi>by the light of Nature</hi> that there is a Conſcience in Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Truth is <hi>more fully evident by Scripture.</hi> This Book of Scripture has no Errour in it, 'tis given by inſpiration of God, who as he cannot be deceived himſelf, ſo he cannot lye unto others. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. Now if you hearken to the Scripture, that there is a Conſcience may be proved many wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſcience is often expreſly ſpoken of.</hi> The Lord who made Man, and who perfectly knowes what is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44406:14"/> in Man; tells us of ſuch a thing as Conſcience. Not onely in the Text is Conſcience mentioned, but in divers other places. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Which was a figure</hi> (ſpeaking of the Tabernacle) <hi>for the time then preſent, in which were offered both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins, which could not make him that did the Service perfect, as pertaining to the Conſcience.</hi> The Conſcience of Man could not be purified or purged by the Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but all theſe were typical of that Sacrifice which Chriſt offered up of himſelf unto God, which alone can <hi>purge the Conſcience from dead Works,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. So alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>We have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftyneſs, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the truth commending our ſelves to every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> We are to ſpeak unto Conſcience to commend our ſelves unto Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: how could this be, were there not a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That work of the Spirit called Conviction, proves a Conſcience.</hi> When the Spirit comes to work upon any, he firſt convinces them of Sin, and afterwards of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. he firſt ſhewes by what they are fallen, and then how they may be raiſed and recovered. But Conſcience is that which is the Subject of this Conviction. When Chriſt ſaid unto the Scribes and Phariſees, who brought an Adultereſs before him; <hi>He that is without Sin among you let him firſt caſt a Stone at her</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>when they heard it, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by their own Conſcience,</hi> 
               <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apparet hic quanta vis eſt malae Conſcientiae. Quum impii iſti hypocritae Chriſtum ſuis cavillis eludere in animo haberent; ſimul tamen ac eorum conſcientias unâ voce pungit; perculſi diffugiunt hoc malleo frangenda eſt hypocritarum ſuperbia.</hi> Calv. <hi>in Johan.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>they went out one</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44406:14"/> 
               <hi>by one, beginning at the eldeſt even unto the laſt,</hi> Joh. 8. 7, 9. When the Law came with power upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and 'twas interpreted, and the extent of it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit, <hi>Sin revived, and he died,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. that is, his Conſcience was awakened to take notice of Sin, and he perceived, that he was a dead, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man by Law; and that there was no way to be delivered without a Mediator. In conviction the Conſcience is ſtruck at, there is the alarum heard, which cauſes ſuch Terrour and Confuſion; and if there were no Conſcience there could be no Conviction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sinning against Conſcience hightens tranſgerſſion, but this ſuppoſes a Conſcience to be ſinned againſt.</hi> Our Lord ſayes plainly, <hi>He that knowes his Maſters will,</hi> and goes againſt the Light of his Conſcience, <hi>prepares not himſelf, nor does according to the will of his Lord, he ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luk. 12. 47. When ſinners do not like to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; when they are troubled becauſe Conſcience puts them in mind that the Lord obſerves them; when they impriſon as it were the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, and ſtifle the Light that ſtirs in them, becauſe they love the works of Darkneſs; this is to ſin with an high hand, and will add much both unto Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Several Duties which are injoyned and urged in Scripture, ſuppoſe a Conſcience in us, becauſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a Principal agent in the performance of them.</hi> We are commanded <hi>to ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> that we may <hi>turn unto the Lord our God,</hi> Lam. 3. 40. but 'tis the work of Conſcience thus to call us to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and to examine how our Actions, and that Rule which is given us, have agreed together. VVe are commanded to <hi>try and prove our ſelves, whether we be in the Faith, whether Chriſt be in us yea or no?</hi> 2 Cor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44406:15"/> 13. 5. Now 'tis Conſcience which takes notice of the Characters of true and unfeigned Faith which the holy Ghoſt has given; 'tis Conſcience alſo which applies theſe Characters; and then drawes the concluſion either that we are not believers if our Faith be dead, and we onely name the name of Chriſt, but have no will to depart from iniquity: or that we are Believers if our Faith purifie our hearts, if it work by love, if it overcome the world, ſo that all things are counted loſs that we may win Chriſt who is truly precious. Finally we are commanded <hi>to judge our ſelves that we may not be condemned with the world.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 31, 32. But this judging is an act of Conſcience. And truly it Judges under God, and by his Authority, and therefore its Judgement is the more to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All men in Scripture are divided <hi>into good and bad, and in both there is a Conſcience.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that in the <hi>defiled and unbelieving there is a Conſcience though a polluted one.</hi> Tit. 1. 15. and though for a while it may ſeem to be aſleep, though it may be ſo unfaithful as ſeldom to admoniſh; yet at length 'twill awake, and then 'twill be found that it knowes and remembers all misdoings. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate likewiſe have a Conſcience which is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and purged, and renewed, by the Blood, and VVord, and Spirit of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As 'tis clear from Scripture, that there is a Conſcience in Man, <hi>ſo 'tis evident by experience.</hi> And here I ſhall make an appeal unto every ones ſenſe and obſervation, in three following queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">

When Satan and a deceitful Heart do plead for Sin, and perſwade to it by this argument, that never any are likely to know it; yet even then conſcience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares againſt it, and cryes out <hi>Oh do not that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing which God hates.</hi> 'Twas well ſaid by one of the Ancients to the Gentiles: <hi>Vos conſcios timetis, nos conſcientiam.</hi> You are afraid leſt others ſhould be conſcious to what you do, we fear even our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44406:16"/> a great deal of Power does mind us of ſuch Scriptures: <hi>God has appointed a day wherein he will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Acts 17. 31. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. And Conſcience knowing theſe Terrors of the Lord, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men to Repentance, and to labour, that whether preſent or abſent, they may be accepted of him. 'Twas a ſaying of <hi>Tertullian, Conſcientia eſt prae-judicium extremi judicii.</hi> Conſcience is a Judging before the laſt Judgment; but ſtill it tells of, and referrs to the laſt Judgment, that hereby the Heart may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What is it but Conſcience which urges unto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Duties, the Omiſſion of which the World can take no notice of?</hi> There is a Monitor within us, which tells us that <hi>our Father is, and ſees in ſecret, and will reward openly</hi> ſuch as ſecretly and ſincerely ſeek him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. When our Hearts (the deſperate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof is not quite cured in the beſt of us) draw back from Prayer in the Cloſet, Conſcience then preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to it, and pleads the Command, the Advantage, what an Evidence 'tis of uprightneſs to be often with God alone. This ſame Monitor likewiſe puts us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſearching into, and ſtudy of the Scripture, for 'tis the Character and property of the Bleſſed Man <hi>to have his Delight in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law to Meditate Day and Night,</hi> Pſal. 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>What is it but Conſcience that applies Truths par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, which are more generally delivered in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel?</hi> I grant indeed that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is the Work of the Spirit of God, but the Conſcience of Man is made uſe of herein by the Holy Spirit. The Preacher ſhoots a great many Arrows.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44406:16"/> The Spirit does direct them to particular Perſons, and Conſcience takes notice where the Arrow ſticks. The ſame Language which was in the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Mouth to <hi>David</hi> after his ſo foul a fall, is in the Mouth of Conſcience. The Word ſpeaks in the general, <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall dye, the Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> But then Conſcience crys out, <hi>Thou art the man that haſt ſinned,</hi> and therefore Death and Deſtruction will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-take thee, unleſs there be a coming by Faith unto a Saviour, and a turning out of thy Deſtructive ways.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44406:17"/> the Matter and the Manner of our Actions. Conſcience Examines whether Love to the Lord conſtrain us to his Work, whether the pleaſing, honouring, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God be our great Deſign, whether our Hearts and Affections be in our Services. After thy Praying, and Hearing, and Receiving are ended, doeſt thou not find ſomething within thee, running over all thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and calling thee to Account, whether thou haſt Prayed with Faith and Fervency, whether thou haſt heard believingly and with attention, whether thou haſt received worthily?

'Tis a ſore trouble to have an Houſe that is really haunted with Spirits, to be diſturbed with noiſes, voices, and frighting Apparitions. 'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exceeding grievous to be haunted with an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to have this continually Objecting the guilt which we have contracted, and affrighting us with the Wrath of God, the Chains of Darkneſs, and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Eternal Fire, which are threatned againſt the Workers of Iniquity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Oh Conſcience, how inſuperable are thy Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! Though Satan the Accuſer of the Brethren call me <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> though <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pſeudo-Catholicks do call me <hi>Heretick,</hi> though furious and uncharitable Proteſtants do call me <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> yet if Conſcience rightly informed by the Word of God ſay I am ſincere, I ſhall have Peace, whoever endeavour to diſturb me.</p>
            <p>Thus have I proved at large that there is a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Man: I now add theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This thing, called Conſcience, is in every one;</hi> there is no Man without it. You may as well ſuppoſe a Man without an Underſtanding as without a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and without a power to know any thing, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a power to reflect upon himſelf. Every reaſonable Soul, being capable both of Sin and Grace, is endued with a power of reflecting upon it ſelf, that ſin may be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44406:18"/> condemned, and Grace may be approved. All are called upon <hi>to conſider their ways,</hi> Hag. 1. 5. 7. but to take our own ways into conſideration, is the work of Conſcience, Conſcience therefore is in all. Let none therefore ſin preſumptuouſly and ſecurely, as if they had no Conſcience at preſent to Obſerve them, or at any time to Reproach and torture them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Conſcience, <hi>when awakened, will deal plainly with the greateſt.</hi> It regards not the high Eſtate of Perſons, but will tell them their own without Flattery. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at firſt crys out, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould Obey his Voice? I know not the Lord, neither will I let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. But afterwards the Lords Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought, and the Plagues which he inflicted upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> awakened the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and he crys out unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, I have ſinned, the Lord is Righteous, and I and my People are wicked,</hi> Exod. 9. 27. He ſpeaks this Language unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe Conſcience had before ſpoken the ſame Language to him, and had told him of his ſin and wickedneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of that God whom he had exalted himſelf againſt.</p>
            <p>Conſcience did flie in the Face of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> though ſo great a Monarch, when the Hand did write his doom upon the Wall, and put him into ſuch a conſternation, <note n="*" place="margin">Sa. Danyel. <hi>Life and Reign of Henry</hi> 1 pag. 65, 66.</note> 
               <hi>that his countenance was changed, the joynts of his Loins were looſed, and his Knees ſmote one againſt another,</hi> Dan. 5. 6. After King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt had put out the Eyes of <hi>Robert</hi> his Eldeſt Brother, and had loſt <hi>William</hi> his Eldeſt and onely Son in a Storm at Sea, this ſudden clap of Gods Judgment did make his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhrink with terror; his ſleeps were very tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and full of Affrightments, wherein he would
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44406:18"/> often riſe, and take his Sword, and be in Act as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf againſt aſſaults of his Perſon: And the Hiſtorian ſays, the King was never ſeen to Laugh after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> Obſerves, how the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Kings have been ſtartled when Death has been within view, and have forced them to do what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they refuſed, and then adds theſe words, <note n="(*)" place="margin">Hiſt. of the World, lib. 5. c. 6. Sect. 12. pag. 669.</note> 
               <hi>O eloquent, juſt, and mighty Death! whom none could adviſe, thou haſt perſwaded; what none hath dared, thou haſt done; and whom all the World hath flattered, thou onely haſt cast out of the World and deſpiſed: thou haſt drawn together all the far-ſtretched greatneſs; all the Pride, Cruelty, and Ambition of Man, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it over with theſe two narrow words,</hi> Hic jacet, <hi>here it all lies buried.</hi> Conſcience reſpects not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Princes, but will flie in the Face of the proudeſt of them when God does give it a Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſcience is not to be eſcaped;</hi> we can no more flie from Conſcience than we can run away from our ſelves. When the Lord gives this Officer a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Power to ſpeak, we are forced to hear it: as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks concerning God himſelf, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? Whither ſhall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? If I aſcend into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold, thou art there; if I take the wings of the Morning and fly to the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, thy Hand will reach me; if I ſay the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall cover me, the Night ſhall be light about me,</hi> Pſal. 139. 7-11. So truly theſe words may in part be applyed unto Conſcience. <hi>Whither ſhall we go from our own Spirits? whither ſhall we flee from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Conſciences? 'Twill go after us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'twill follow us down to Hell; if we travel into</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:44406:19"/> 
               <hi>the remoteſt Regions, we cannot ſhake off Conſcience, but 'twill be our Companion and Obſerver. No dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can hide any thing from its view, but the Night ſhineth as the Day, the darkneſs and the light are both alike to it.

                  <hi>Peccata mea celare non poſſum quoniam quocunque vado conſcientia mea mecum eſt, ſecum portans quid in eâ poſui, ſive bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſive malum: Servat vivo, reſtituet defuncto depoſitum quod ſervandum accepit.

(mihi) 1060.</note> My ſins I am not able to conceal, becauſe where ever I go my Conſcience is continually with me, and carries with it what I have put in it, whether it be good or evil. It keeps for me living, it will reſtore to me dying, what I have delivered to be kept by it. If I do evil, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is preſent; if I ſeem to do good, and am lifted up with Pride, Conſcience is preſent. It accompanies me all my Life long; 'twill follow me after Death, and will be my inſeparable either Glory or Confuſion, according to the Quality of what it has Obſerved in me. Thus, thus in my own Houſe, in my own Soul, I have Accuſers, Witneſſes, Judges, Tormentors, if I dare to give way unto Iniquity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though Conſcience may ſeem to be quite baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for the preſent does no more its Office, than if there were no ſuch thing, yet this Exiled and Baniſhed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44406:19"/> thing will at laſt return; or to ſpeak more properly, this Conſcience, that was imagined to be in a dead ſleep, or altogether careleſs, will ſhew that it has been too much preſent with the guilty all along. Theſe ſix particulars are here to be Obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some great Affliction may awaken Conſcience.</hi> When the Widow with whom <hi>Elijah</hi> ſojourned, her Son fell ſick, and his ſickneſs was ſo ſore, that there was no breath left in him, her Conſcience was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſtartled, and ſhe ſaid to <hi>Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou Man of God, art thou come unto me to call my ſin to remembrance, and to ſlay my Son?</hi> 1 Kings 17. 17, 18. The Locuſts which were ſo very grievous that came over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> extorted a Confeſſion from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Conſcience, though his Heart was before hardned: <hi>He called for</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>in haſte, and ſaid, I have ſinned againſt the Lord and againſt you; now therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, I pray thee, my ſin this once, and intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this Death onely,</hi> Exod. 10. 16, 17. How does Affliction give new Eyes, and make ſin appear in other colours than before it ſeemed to have! When the Body of a ſinner is firſt ſtruck with a Diſeaſe, and the mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends this Sickneſs may prove deadly, and that now being Arreſted, the ſinner muſt quickly appear before the Judgment-ſeat. Ohthen, what a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there in the Soul, and how fierce and clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Conſcience which before was deeply ſilent!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſcience may awake after a fall into ſome ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſin.</hi> When the long covered Hypocriſie is detected, and the ſly ſinner which waxed worſe and worſe, and yet was ſecure, at length does commit ſome ſin that the World crys ſhame on: Oh then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44406:20"/> may joyn in with the VVorlds clamors, <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non aurem ſolam percutit iracundia criminantis, verùm eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am conſcientiam mordet veritas criminis.</hi> Auguſt. l. 3. contra lit. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian. Tom. 7.</note> and tell him that now his ſin has found him out, and that Heaven has revealed his iniquity, and that becauſe <hi>he has deſpiſed God, he has been ſuffered to do that which has made himſelf to be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſcience may awake at the hearing of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful Sermon.</hi> The meſſengers of the Lord are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to lift up <hi>their Voices like a Trumpet,</hi> and the deſign is to ſtartle Conſcience, and that ſinners may be made ſenſible of <hi>and to know their Tranſgreſſions, Iſaiah</hi> 58. 1. God ſpeaks thus to the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, chap.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Smite with thine hand, and ſtamp with thy foot, and ſay, Alas! for all the evil abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Theſe geſtures, this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and crying out of abominations, is uſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Hearts which before were ſtupid. And truly the VVord of God has oftentimes taken impreſſion, even upon thoſe whoſe Souls were more than ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſeleſs. The Apoſtles hearers were mockers, and yet the VVord being ſet home they <hi>were prickt at the Heart, (and ſaid,) Men and Brethren what ſhall we do? Act.</hi> 2. 37. Now when the VVord does awaken the Conſcience there is more ground to hope that God has a deſign to work a ſaving change, and that the troubles of Spirit are but as it were the pangs which fore-run the new Birth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſcience may awake when Death is within view.</hi> I grant indeed that 'tis too common for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to dy ſtupid, and that <hi>there may be no bands in their death, Pſal.</hi> 73. but yet experience ſhews that the approach of death does alſo fill many ungodly ones with horrour and amazement. What made <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44406:20"/> to cry out, <hi>let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his? Num.</hi> 23. 10. Surely he had pre-apprehenſions how terrible a thing 'tis for the ungodly to dye. When nature is almoſt ſpent and the earthly Tabernacle is tottering and falling to the ground; when Phyſicians are at a loſſe, and friends ſtand by weeping, and 'tis whiſpered in the room, <hi>Alas he cannot live many hours to an end.</hi> Ah then Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may wake in terrible fright and the ſinner may be confounded, and as death comes with its ſting, ſo it may prove indeed the King of terrours.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To be ſure at judgment Conſcience will be awaked thoroughly,</hi> though ſinners poſſibly may look death, yet they cannot look the Judge in the face without being daunted. He will ſtrike terrour into the Hearts of thoſe ſinners that were moſt obſtinate and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

The Heart of Man is capable of knowing it ſelf and other things; when it underſtands other things this is <hi>ſcience,</hi> but when it reflects upon it ſelf this is <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And indeed the Heart is in a ſpecial manner obſerved, both by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and by the Lord himſelf. Conſcience if it be rightly informed, will not be contented with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which Men look upon as blameleſſe; unleſſe the Heart be upright and pure. <note n="(*)" place="margin">

               </note> If a man harbour malice in his breaſt, Conſcience will charge him with Murther. If he look upon a Woman to luſt after her, it will call him before God, Adulterer. If he abound never ſo much in profeſſion, and external performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet if when he honours God with his lips, his Heart be removed far from him; Conſcience will ſay he is a meer Hypocrite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis called Conſcience becauſe it is <hi>concludens ſcientia,</hi> a concluding knowledge, which is gathered from ſome premiſes that went before. Conſcience therefore is ſtyled by ſome a practical Syllogiſm, in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44406:22"/> which the major or firſt propoſition is the VVord of God, the minor or ſecond propoſition is from a reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our ſelves, whether we have done according unto or againſt the VVord of God. And the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a paſſing ſentence upon our ſelves, according to the ſame VVord. The Scripture ſays, <hi>To be carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded is death;</hi> and the Conſcience of a ſinner, adds, <hi>but I am carnally minded, and I ſavour nothing elſe but what is carnal,</hi> and <hi>therefore I am a Childe of Death.</hi> And again thus, <hi>He that loves the World, the Love of the Father is not in him;</hi> but ſayes the Conſcience of a worlding, <hi>I love the World, am gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy after it, and deſire nothing comparable to it,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I neither Love the Father, nor have an intereſt in his Love.</hi> On the other hand, the Scripture affirms, <hi>He that receives Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> but ſayes the Believers Conſcience. <hi>I am willing to receive Chriſt, to rule me, and to ſave me;</hi> therefore <hi>I am the childe of God.</hi> And again; <hi>thoſe are bleſſed that Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs;</hi> but ſayes the Believers Conſcience, <hi>I Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs, I deſire to be made truly Holy, to be ſanctified throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I am in a bleſſed State.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. 'Tis called Conſcience, becauſe it is <hi>cum alio ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi> a knowledge together with ſome other. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuppoſes that we are known to ſome other, as well as to our ſelves, and this is the beſt reaſon why 'tis called Conſcience.

And indeed if there were not a God who knows us as well, nay, better than we do our ſelves; we ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our own being privy to our wickedneſſe; there is ſo much Self-Love, that we ſhould not ſtand in awe of our own knowledge: but when we conſider that the Lord alſo knows us, this cauſes Grief, and Fear, and Trouble when we do Evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus who is ready to judge the quick and dead, does alſo know our works.</hi> In all thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which he ſends to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>I know thy works.</hi> 'Tis expreſly ſaid, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus knew all men, and needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of Man, for he knew what was in Man. John</hi> 2. 24. 25. He underſtands the very ſecrets of the Heart, as well as what appears in the practice: and our Lord being to give every one his final doom, and to paſſe that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which can never be repealed, ſurely his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould damp the fierceſt Temptations, and make us diligent that we may be found of him in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot and blameleſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Elect Angels are witneſſes of more than we are aware of.</hi> Upon this ſcore it is that the Apoſtle in his charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> mentions the Angels, as well as God and Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels</hi>

The work of the Angels lies very much here in the Church Militant, they are Miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to Miniſter for them that are Heirs of Salvation; they rejoyce at the Converſion of a Sinner; and ſurely then the ſins of men diſpleaſe them, and they are ready upon Gods command to be the inſtruments of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging juſtice upon thoſe who dare to Rebel againſt him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Devils who are ready to be our Accuſers, are alſo our Obſervers:</hi> They tempt us to ſin, and if we yeild to their Temptations, are forward to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. Satan indeed is a Spirit, and ſo inviſible; but We are not inviſible: he knows where we are, and what we do; nay, he can give a very ſhrode gheſſe at our very thoughts, and he does accordingly ſuit his baits and Temptations with marvellous ſubtlety. And becauſe the Enemy obſerves us, and if we do wickedly, though ſecretly, will accuſe us before God and take advantage againſt us to get us more under his power; therefore it infinitely concerns us to be <hi>ſober and vigilant againſt this Adverſary, and to reſiſt him, being ſtedfaſt in the Faith, who goes about like a Roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the reaſon of the Name Conſcience, it implies that others know us together with our ſelves. Ah! let us not flatter our ſelves with hopes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy in ſinning. More eyes than we imagine, behold
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44406:23"/> us when we are committing the moſt concealed abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Devils look on, for they egg us to them. Angels look on and are angry. God looks on, who hates Sin with a moſt perfect hatred. Chriſt alſo takes notice, whoſe wrath is terrible; for who can appeaſe it? whoſe Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, and who has ſaid, <hi>I will make all the Churches to know that I am he which Searcheth the Reines and Hearts, and I will render to every Man according to his Deeds,</hi> Rev. 2. 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus of the name Conſcience, next of the thing it ſelf. And here I ſhall not trouble you with thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and diſputes in the Schools about Conſcience. I ſhall not take up time in determining thoſe queſtions, whether Conſcience be a diſtinct faculty in the Soul, from the underſtanding, or an Act of it? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis to be reſtrained to the underſtanding, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs alſo to the will and affections? whether it be an habit or no? Theſe and ſuch like queſtions will have a ſmall influence unto the bettering of Conſcience, and therefore I wave them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> gives this deſcription of Conſcience, that <note n="(z)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Spiritus corrector &amp; paedagogus animae ſocialis, quo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à malis &amp; adhaeret bonis.</hi> Origen. lib. 2. <hi>in ep. ad Rom.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It is a Spirit which accompanies the Soul as a Schoolmaſter and corrector, whereby 'tis ſeparated from what is evil, and adheres and cleaves to what is good.</hi> If by Spirit here <hi>Origen</hi> mean a good <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> (as ſome interpret him:) then 'tis to be reckoned among his phancyes which have no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-foundation: but if by Spirit, he mean a mans own Spirit, then 'tis a profitable deſcription; for Conſcience is indeed a Schoolmaſter to inſtruct us in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44406:24"/> our Duty, and 'twill correct us ſharply when we ſin, and the laſhes given by this Corrector are very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and that which Conſcience aims at, is, that we may be deterr'd from Sin, and follow after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas</hi> defines Conſcience after this manner; <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Conſcientia est actus quo ſcientiam nostram ad ea quae agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus applicamus.</hi> Aquin. primae Qu. 79. artic. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Conſcience is an act whereby we apply our knowledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe things which we do.</hi> Now he makes three wayes of applying our knowledge; 1. When we take notice what we have done, or not done; and ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſaid to Teſtifie. 2. When we judge that this or that is to be done, or not to be done; and ſo Conſcience is ſaid to Binde. 3. When we pronounce what we have done, to be well or ill done, and ſo Conſcience is ſaid to Excuſe, or to be full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ameſius</hi> tells us, that <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Conſcienta eſt judicium hominis de ſeipſo, prout ſubjicitur ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio Dei.</hi> Ameſ. De Conſ. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Conſcience is a Mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, as he is ſubject unto the judgement of God.</hi> The Lord has given unto Man his Word for his Rule, and the Lord himſelf will be his judge, now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is perſwaded that this judgement is certain, and that an account of our ſelves and actions muſt ſhortly be rendred; therefore it paſſes a judgement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. It meddles not ſo much with others, only ſo far as Duty towards them is to be performed; or we make our ſelves partakers of their Sins. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience has chiefly to do with our ſelves; and truly it tryes and judges concerning both our Eſtates and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether we be in an Eſtate of Nature or of Grace, whether our Actions be Good or Evil.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:44406:24"/>
            <p> Others do call Conſcience, <hi>the Soul of Man recoiling and reflecting upon it ſelf.</hi> Theſe Recoyls are Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beat us to the Ground, nay ſtrike us down to the very brink of Hell many times; when we look back upon our miſcarriages, and our Sins are ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before us, and our eyes are held waking, ſo that we can neither ſhut them nor look away. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections alſo are accompanied with great pleaſure, when the Lord does work in us both to will and to do that which is good of his own good pleaſure, and then ſhines upon his own workmanſhip; ſo that we know both that God has made us upright, <hi>and takes Pleaſure in our uprightneſs.</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 17.</p>
            <p>But the Definition which I ſhall give you of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and at large Explain, is this; <hi>Conſcience is a power of the Soul in Man, whereby we underſtanding the Will of God, are impell'd to comply with it; and do bear witneſſe concerning our ſelves and actions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly judge, that is, acquit or condemn our ſelves.</hi> This Definition I ſhall take into parts that you may the better underſtand it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſcience is a Power in the Soul of Man.</hi> 'Tis a Power or faculty becauſe it produceth acts, and is not got or loſt as habits are; but is inſeparable from the Soul, immoveable from the Subject. I will not affirm that Conſcience is really diſtinct from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but 'tis the underſtanding it ſelf acting by way of Reflection. The Underſtanding does Act direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it apprehends what is True and Falſe, what is Good and Bad; Abſolutely and without Reſpect. But it Acts by way of Reflection, when it applyes what it apprehends, and Reflects thus; Is that which is True and Good embraced, which is ſo worthy of all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44406:25"/> Acceptation? Is that which is Evil and Falſe, Rejected and abhorred?</p>
            <p>This Power call'd Conſcience is very notable: the Eyes of the Body indeed, can look every where but inward; but the Eyes of the Soul can look within as well as abroad. And this looking within is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of great uſe; for till we come to know our ſelves, we ſhall know nothing elſe after a right manner. The Heathen Poet complains,<hi>—Nemo in ſeſe tentat deſcendere, Nemo;</hi> No man does endeavour to deſcend into himſelf; But Conſcience taking the Word, which is the candle of Lord, does thus Deſcend, and makes a Diſcovery of us to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſcience implies ſome knowledge of the Will of God.</hi> Knowledge is the Light which Conſcience is directed by, and the Will and Law of God is that which binds the Conſcience. <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Distinguitur Conſcientia à nudâ veritatis apprehenſione, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſum enim aliquem, eumque firmum in ſeſe continet ſemper.</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius. <hi>De Conſc.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> The Will of God is not onely underſtood, but alſo an aſſent is yeilded to it, and there is a perſwaſion, that 'tis indeed his Will; Hence 'tis that conſcience does more peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily call for Subjection to it. VVere there no Light or Underſtanding of the Lords will, Conſcience could not Act at all. There is a threefold Light which is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the illumination of Conſcience, that Gods Will and Mans Duty may be the better underſtood: <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Moral, Evangelical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Light of Nature does diſcover many things, and informs the Conſcience of ſeveral duties;</hi> though this Light does not tell us one word of Chriſt in whom <note place="margin">(*)<hi>Perſeus.</hi> Satyr. 4.</note>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44406:25"/> we have Righteouſneſs to juſtifie us, and Strength to perform what God requires; yet when Men are about to Sin, this Light does oppoſe many of the works of Darkneſs; and ſo renders them the more inexcuſable, when they give way to their iniquities. The Lord is pleaſed to grant the Light of Nature to them unto whom the Goſpel never came, and by a diligent improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this one Talent, how many Sins might they avoid, which being committed will make their miſery the greater in another world. Conſcience was buſie in the very Gentiles, and told them that ſuch and ſuch things were forbidden, but the reſtraints of Conſcience were but feeble. <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <l>—Video meliora proboque</l>
                  <l>Detcriora ſequor—</l>
               </note> Therefore <hi>Medea</hi> cryes out <hi>Though I ſee and approve what is good, yet I follow and practiſe what is evil.</hi> And <hi>Horace</hi> complaines, <hi>Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.</hi> Conſcience tells man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that wickedneſs is forbidden, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ruſh into it, and are at length ruined by it.</p>
            <p>Though Chriſtians who enjoy the Oracles of God, have from thence a fuller underſtanding of the Lords VVill; yet the Light of Nature is not to be neglected. And thoſe Sins which are againſt the Light of Nature, as injuſtice, perjury, whoredome and the like, are carefully to be Eſchewed: And ſuch abominations will be the more Abominable if Acted by thoſe who have a further light than that of Nature to inſtruct them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a Light which may be called Moral,</hi> whereby Conſcience is informed concerning the will of God. This Light ſhined, as it were, from Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> when it was on fire, and the Lord was pleaſed to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44406:26"/> ſpeak himſelf the ten Words or Commandments to the People. Theſe Commandments are delivered at large, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and in theſe he does more fully ſhew us what is good, and what he does require of us; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing but what is good in it ſelf, good to us, is required; and hereby our Obligation to Obedience is heightned, when the Authority of the Law-giver, and the profitableneſs of the Laws go hand in hand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A great part of the Scripture is but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary which the Holy Spirit himſelf has made upon the ten Commandments: and truly the Commentary and the Text are of equal Authority, and both alike to be regarded by the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>That Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger be put away from you, with all kind of malice,</hi> is a Commentary upon that Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> And that Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie therefore your Members upon the Earth, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Inordinate affection, and evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence,</hi> is a Commentary upon that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> I might inſtance in the reſt, to ſhew that the Commands of God are exceeding broad, and extend not onely to the whole Converſation, but even to the very thoughts and affections: there is not one Member of our Bodies but is under a Law, to be employed <hi>as an Inſtrument of Righteouſneſs unto Holineſs,</hi> Rom. 6. 19. There is no power of our Souls but God requires it ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, and exerciſed for him. The Law is ſo pure and Spiritual, that it cannot allow of a wicked thought, of a carnal deſire, of a bad intent or deſign. All this Conſcience muſt be informed of, that it may be the more faithful in charging us to endeavour after an univerſal Obedience, and conformity of our whole man unto the will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44406:26"/> 3. <hi>There is a Light which may be ſtiled Evangelical.</hi> The Light of the Goſpel alſo ſerves to enlighten the Conſcience; 'tis called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 11. and from God the Author of it, does flow its Authority, to bind the Conſcience to Obey it. The Goſpel as it contains Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes <hi>exceeding great and precious,</hi> ſo alſo Precepts which are ſo ſuited unto our preſent ſtate, as that by the power of the ſpecial Grace of God which is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to us, we are able to Obey. So that <hi>though the Law is weak through the Fleſh,</hi> and we are not able to keep it, and obtain Life by that means; yet the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel does abate of the Laws rigour; and if we believe in Jeſus, and are holy in ſincerity, notwithſtanding we fall ſhort of abſolute perfection; our Grace being true ſhall through Chriſt be accepted and rewarded.</p>
            <p>'Tis well that Conſcience is to be directed by the Light of the Goſpel, for the Law <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nihil gravius, nihil miſerius conſcientiâ territâ lege Dei &amp; conſpectu peccatorum.</hi> Luther. Tom. 4. in Pſal. 128.</note> conſidered in it ſelf, and not in the hand of a Mediator, can diſcover nothing to the Conſcience of a Tranſgreſſor, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of horror and deſperation: For the Law being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Life is loſt, and the curſe is due; nay, every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion has power ſufficient to lay us under the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> and having thundered out the curſe, the Law leaves a Man under it, and does not tell him of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But now the Goſpel commands Repentance, which the Law allows not of, and encourages to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by aſſuring us, if we Repent we ſhall not periſh, but <hi>our ſins ſhall be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44406:27"/> Acts 3. 19. The Goſpel alſo does command a ſinner to come to Chriſt, to believe in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>This is his commandment, that we believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That is, that we receive him as Lord and Saviour, and accept thoſe benefits of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Grace, and Glory which he has purchaſed, and freely proffers to us. And thus by this command Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is obliged to do that as a Duty, which is one of the greateſt Priviledges imaginable.</p>
            <p>You ſee what bindes the Conſcience, namely, <hi>the will of God diſcovered;</hi> partly, by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but principally by the Law and Goſpel. <note n="(f)" place="margin">

               </gap>, which ſignifies to keep; becauſe practical Truths are to be Treaſured up there: we muſt be acquainted what is the will of God, and do that will as well as underſtand it. The adequate Rule of Conſcience is the will of God, and of this will in his Word there is the fulleſt Revelation; here mans Duty is preſcribed and ſhewn, and ſo far as the Word commands, Conſcience is obliged, and no further. As God alone knows the Conſcience, and has power to puniſh it, ſo he alone can bind it. I acknowledge that for Conſcience ſake we are bound to obey the juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Men that are in Authority over us: but the Obligation upon Conſcience to do this comes not from them, but from Gods command, that we <hi>ſhould be</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44406:27"/> 
               <hi>Subject to them, and to be ready unto every good Work,</hi> Tit. 3. 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As Conſcience implies a knowledge of the will of God, <hi>ſo 'tis the Office of Conſcience to impell us to comply with his will which is made known to us.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaking concerning the Spirit bringing the Word to remembrance, tells the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Thine Ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk in it when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi> Theſe words may very aptly be applied unto Conſcience, which is as a Voice within us, ſaying concerning forbidden paths, <hi>Theſe are not the way,</hi> and therefore turn out of them; but concerning commanded Duties, <hi>Theſe are the way,</hi> and therefore practiſe them. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſollicited by his Miſtreſs to commit folly, and the temptation was ſtrong, conſidering the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which he was in, It was Conſcience that mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his Obligation to his Maſter, which he ought not to requite by defiling of his Bed; and eſpecially how evil and hainous ſuch a deed would be in the Lords eyes: and he comes to a fixed reſolution not to yield, not to go contrary to his Conſcience and Duty. <hi>How</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhall I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. 39. 9. Conſcience is not onely a witneſs to teſtifie concerning us, nor onely a Judge to paſs Sentence upon us, but alſo a Law commanding and ſtirring us up unto our Duty, and when it does thus excite us to Obedience, Firſt, <hi>it uſes Gods Name and Authority:</hi> Secondly, <hi>it charges under the greateſt penalties:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>it ſets before us the Lords great goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſcience to impell us to Obedience <hi>uſes Gods own Name and Authority. Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> ſays
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44406:28"/> Conſcience: Theſe commands are the commands of God, they are enacted by Him who is the ſupream <hi>Law-giver, who hath power to ſave and to deſtroy,</hi> James 4. 12. The <hi>Theſſalonians when they received the Word of God which they heard of the Apoſtles, they received it not as the word of Men, but as it is in Truth the word of God, which worketh effectually in them that believe,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. Conſcience charged them to receive the Goſpel, becauſe the Goſpel of God; and they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, though hereupon they were expoſed to never ſo great Afflictions and Tribulations. Conſcience looks beyond Inſtruments, which are but Earthen Veſſels, Men of like paſſions with our ſelves; and eyes that God who employs and ſends them. In the Publiſhing of a Proclamation, who ſays, <hi>Thus ſaith the Town-Clerk?</hi> No, every one concludes, <hi>Thus ſaith the King.</hi> This is really the will of God, ſays Conſcience, and therefore do not dare to be obſtinate againſt it. It uſes the ſame Language which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does to <hi>Timothy,</hi> after it has urged unto Duty, and to take heed of ſin: <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall Judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1. Here is ſuch a Name and Authority uſed as may well make us to ſtand in awe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience <hi>charges us under the greateſt penalties.</hi> It tells us indeed of temporal plagues, and Spiritual Judgments, and how much ſin may coſt us in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World; but that's not all, nor the worſt of all; it alſo makes <hi>Hell naked</hi> before us, and takes off that <hi>covering which is upon Deſtruction,</hi> and bids us look down, and then asks this Queſtion, <hi>How will you be able to dwell with devouring fire? How will you be able to inhabit everlaſting burnings?</hi> Is it good, ſays Conſcience, to Live without God in this World, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44406:28"/> with a curſe to depart for ever from him in the next? Isit good to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon, and then to be tormented in thoſe Flames which never can be quenched? To run into ſin, is to ruſh into a Battel againſt that God, againſt whom none ever hardned themſelves and proſpered. To run into ſin is a mad venturing to leap into Hell; think of this when tempted. Oh how ſlender are the penalties wherewith Humane Laws are backed! Thoſe Statutes which were made by ſevere <hi>Draco,</hi> which are ſaid to be writ with Blood, becauſe he puniſhed every fault with Death; had not ſuch a dreadful penalty annexed to them, as the Laws of God: For what is the Death of the Body, if compared with the Damnation of the Body and Soul for ever? <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſcience that it may perſwade us to Obedience, <hi>ſets before us the Lords great goodneſs;</hi> bids us <hi>behold his goodneſs as well as his ſeverity,</hi> Rom. 11. 22. It tells us, that if we depart from God, we forſake our own Mercies, we leave our Rock and Fortreſs, and betray our ſelves into the hands of Enemies. It uſes the cords of Love to draw us after God, as well as the Reins of fear to reſtrain us from ſin.</p>
            <p>It brings Mercies to remembrance, all which (and oh how great is the Number of them!) are as ſo many Obligations to Obedience, and withal aſſures us that God is ſuch a Maſter, that if we follow him fully, we ſhall not want renewed and multiplied encouragements in his Service. What <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpake unto <hi>David</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſin, Conſcience does ſpeak after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before, to keep us within the bounds of our Duty. <hi>God has delivered, he has loaded thee with benefits, and if theſe are too little, he is willing to give more;</hi> and therefore leave him not, but cleave unto him.</p>
            <p>All theſe ways does Conſcience take to move us to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44406:29"/> do the will of God; and indeed eſpecially at ſome times its impulſes are very vehement and ſtrong; it fills its mouth with Arguments, and evidently lays before us the unreaſonableneſs and danger of ſin, and uſes a reſt leſs importunity to diſſwade us from it; and if Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, notwithſtanding all this, be ſtifled, hereby we ſhall vaſtly increaſe our guilt, and our ſinning will become by far the greater provocation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As 'tis the Office of Conſcience to impell us to comply with the will of God, <hi>ſo alſo to bear Witneſs concerning our ſelves and Actions.</hi> As it tells us what we ſhould do, ſo what we do it exactly obſerves. 'Tis very evident from Scripture, that this witneſs-bearing is a main part of the work of Conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my Conſcience alſo bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>the teſtimony of his Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity he had had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the World.</hi> Conſcience is ſuch a witneſs as is more than a thouſand other witneſſes, for 'tis privy to all we do; it will many times cry out againſt us when others flatter us. <note n="(g)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Magna vis est Conſcientiae Judicis, &amp; magna in utramque partem; ut neque timeant qui nihil commiſerint; &amp; poenam ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ante oculos verſari putent qui peccârint.</hi> Cicero, Orat. pro T. An. Milone, pag. 553.</note> And if it teſtifies good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, it will not be controuled by mens cenſures, nor by Afflictions, which are ſeeming tokens of Gods Anger. <hi>Job</hi>'s burthen was very heavy, his griefs and calamities were more weighty than the Sand, ſo that his words were ſwallowed up. His Friends charge him with Hypocriſie, and yet Conſcience witneſſing for him does prevail, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 5. <hi>Till I dye I will not</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:44406:29"/> 
               <hi>remove my integrity from me,</hi> and his Heart wineſſing to his Righteouſneſſe and ſincerity he goes higher, <hi>Job.</hi> 16, 12. <hi>Alſo now behold my witneſs is in Heaven, and my Record is on High.</hi> Three things are implied in this witneſſing of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A recollection of what we have done.</hi> It has a notable faculty in running back upon the footſteps which we have taken. <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cambdens Remains,</hi> pag. 26.</note> The old Engliſh word for Conſcience was <hi>In-wit,</hi> becauſe it knows whatever is within us, whatever is done by us. Thoſe which we read of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 6. who when God hearkned and heard, did not ſpeak aright, did not ſay <hi>What have we done?</hi> 'tis a ſign their Hearts were hardned, and their Conſciences for the preſent caſt into a dead ſleep. But here I muſt ſay that Conſcience, though aſleep is like <hi>Noah,</hi> who knew what his younger Son had done to him, and how he had looked upon his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when he was aſleep. Conſcience when it wakes will underſtand all that was done before; and the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it begins to reflect, the better will it diſcharge its duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This witneſſing of Conſcience implies <hi>a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of what we have done with that rule which God has preſcribed us.</hi> What was feigned concerning <hi>Janus</hi> that ancient King of <hi>Italy,</hi> that he had two faces, may truly be affirmed concerning Conſcience; with one face it looks forward towards the VVord which is the rule of Righteouſneſs, and with the other it looks backwards towards our ſelves, and then inquires whether there be that purity and uprightneſs of Heart, and that living ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, which the VVord does ſo expreſly call for.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44406:30"/> 3. The witneſſing of Conſcience implies <hi>its bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in evidence pro or con, for or againſt us,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we have, or have not taken heed to that <hi>rule, which whoſoever walks according to, Peace and Mercy ſhall be upon them, Gal.</hi> 6. 16. The witneſſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is an accuſation upon doing Evil, but an apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy upon doing well.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This witneſſe of Conſcience is <hi>an accuſation upon doing Evil.</hi> Conſcience does charge the ſoul with guilt and this is a very heavy charge, where ſinners are not without, or paſt feeling. The Conſcience of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him, preſently ſeconded <hi>Nathan.</hi> The Prophet accuſed him, <hi>Thou art the Man,</hi> his Conſcience alſo ſides with the Prophet, and he accuſes himſelf: <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. An accuſing Conſcience made <hi>David</hi> ſo ſenſible of his need of mercy, and ſo earneſt that he might obtain it; the ſight of his ſins cauſed moſt deep dejection of ſpirit. The thirty eight pſalm is called a <hi>Pſalm of David to bring to remembrance.</hi> His conſcience was buſie in reflecting and accuſing when he wrote it; and how does he complain, <hi>v.</hi> 3! <hi>There is not any reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin, for mine iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy burthen, they are too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for me, I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long,</hi> v. 4. 6.</p>
            <p>There are ſix things to be obſerved concerning the accuſations of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſcience accuſes <hi>undeniably,</hi> it does not charge the ſinner upon hear-ſay, or upon ſurmiſe, but upon its own knowledge; <hi>I accuſe of nothing,</hi> ſayes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>but what I ſaw done with my own eyes, and when I ſaw it I wrote it down, with all the aggravating circumſtances of it in my own Book of remembrance, and here you may find it regiſtred.</hi> You may as well
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44406:30"/> deny that you ſee at all, when you ſee moſt plainly, as deny Conſciences accuſing teſtimony. We find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture, that when Conſcience has brought to remembrance ſins committed a great while before, its teſtimony even then could not be denyed. <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren many years after their cruelty towards their Brother, cry out <hi>We are Verily guilty:</hi> Conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and they could not deny it. <hi>Job's</hi> Conſcience told him of the ſins of his youth, when he was grown up to riper years, and he acknowledges them, <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 26. <hi>For thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſſe the iniquities of my Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience accuſes <hi>boldly,</hi> as 'tis ſaid of Death, that it comes as eaſily to the Princes Palace, as the Beggars Cottage; ſo it may be affirmed concerning conſcience, 'twill come and ſpeak as plainly to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as to the meaneſt. 'Tis not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a reſpecter of perſons: Conſcience has no more reaſon to fear the greateſt, than the pooreſt. Can the greateſt man pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his Conſcience for being plain with him? He may indeed wound it more and more, but this will in the end onely increaſe his own ſmart and anguiſh. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Miniſters have not acceſſe unto ſome, nor an opportunity to tell them of their miſdoings, and if they have, and do diſcharge their duty, they may ſuffer for it. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was ſent to Priſon for reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Herod,</hi> and afterwards his life was taken away: But though <hi>Herod</hi> was no more troubled and rebuked by <hi>John,</hi> yet his own Conſcience does fearleſly and impartially deal with him, and therefore when he heard of the fame of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he cries out <hi>John is riſen from the Dead;</hi> which ſhews that his Conſcience flew in his face about him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſcience accuſes <hi>of high matters, of ſuch crimes the leaſt of which deſerves damnation.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44406:31"/> which Conſcience does accuſe of but ſin, and ſin is the Tranſgreſſion of a Law, and that Law is the Law of God, and this God is an infinite Majeſty, and therefore ſin does merit an infinite puniſhment. Though Papiſts call ſome ſins venial, and make but light of them; yet a ſerious Conſcience looks upon every ſin as juſtly deſerving Eternal condemnation: the Apoſtle ſpeaks indefinitely concerning ſin, without excepting any. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> and by Death he means Eternal Death, for 'tis oppoſed unto the gift of God, which is Eternal Life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Among Men there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome petty faults, which a Malefactor is not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid when accuſed of; but how pale does he look, when Felony, or Murther, or Treaſon is laid to his charge, alas the Gallows, the Gibbet, Hanging, Drawing, Quartering; he now fears. Conſcience brings in an indictement againſt the ſinner for nothing but what is damnable, for every ſin againſt the great God, is ſo; in its own Nature. And if every ſin makes the Soul liable to the vengeance of Eternal fire, how may the ſinner be amazed when all his iniquities are ſet in order before him!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſcience accuſes <hi>a man to himſelf. Luther</hi> tells us concerning a certain Cardinal that was wont to ſay. <hi>Conſcientia eſt mala beſtia quae facit hominem ſtare contra ſeipſum.</hi> Conſcience is an evil Beaſt, for it makes a man to ſtand againſt himſelf. When Conſcience is our accuſer, our accuſer is within us, and we can go no where without this accuſer. A man by this means becomes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a ſelf-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Theſe ſelf accuſations do break a mans ſpirit, they imbitter all Temporal comforts, and Oh! how bitter then do they make affliction?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſcience in its accuſations <hi>lets us underſtand,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44406:31"/> 
               <hi>that God underſtands better then it ſelf what it layes to our charge.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>God is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than our Hearts, and knows all things,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3 20. This Text plainly informs us that God knows by us more than we know. Many ſins ſlip out of Our memories, but none out of Gods. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>They conſider not in their Hearts that I remember all their wickedneſs, now their own doings have beſet them round, they are all before my face.</hi> When Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is awakened, and we are beſet round with our own doings, this cauſes the perplexity, that they are all before Gods face, he remembers all, though we are not able to number half of them. <hi>Moſes</hi> cryes out, <hi>We are conſumed by thine anger, by thy wrath are we troubled, Thou haſt ſet our inquities before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy Countenance, Pſal.</hi> 90. 7. 8.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſcience is many times <hi>inceſſant, and not to be ſilenced in its accuſations. Auguſtine</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Qui malas habent uxores domus ſuas intrare nolunt, ad fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum exeunt &amp; gaudent; coepit hora eſſe quâ intraturi ſunt ad domum ſuam &amp; contristantur. Intraturi ſunt ad taedia, ad murmura, ad amaritudines, ad everſiones. Si ergo miſeri ſunt, qui cùm rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ad parietes ſuos timent; quantò miſeriores, qui ad conſcientiam redire nolunt, ne litibus peccatorum evertantur? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t poſſis libens redire ad cor tuum, illud munda. Aufer cupiditatem, ſordes; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer labem avaritiae, malas cogitationes, odia, non dico adverſus amicum, ſed etiam adverſus inimicum; aufer ista omnia Intra cor tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; &amp; gaudebis</hi> Aug. in. <hi>Enarrat.</hi> in Pſal. 33. pag. <hi>(mihi)</hi> 237, 238.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a clamorous Conſcience to a brawling Woman, whoſe Tongue being ſet on fire of Hell, never lies ſtill but is continually ſhooting forth bitter words. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>'Tis better to dwell in the corner of a houſe top than with ſuch a Woman in a wide houſe, Prov.</hi> 25. 24. nay, <hi>'Tis better to dwell in the Wilderneſs</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:44406:32"/> 
               <hi>than with a contentious and angry Woman, Prov.</hi> 21. 19. But how much more intolerable are the reproaches of an enraged Conſcience! Flaſhes of Hell fire do iſſue as it were out of the mouth of it, it is continually bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilt unto remembrance, and ſpeaking of thoſe Flames unto which this guilt does render the Soul that ſins, obnoxious and liable.</p>
            <p>Thus the witneſs of Conſcience is an accuſation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing evil, and ſuch an accuſation as may very much be dreaded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The witneſſe of Conſcience <hi>is an Apology upon doing well.</hi> It will bear witneſſe for thoſe that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, when they walk before God in Truth and with a perfect Heart. It muſt indeed be granted <hi>that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things all</hi> (even the very beſt) <hi>do offend, Jam.</hi> 3. 2. But conſcience takes notice of the bent and deſire of the Soul to pleaſe the Lord, and how burthenſome and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed infirmities are. Conſcience will excuſe and defend if there be a <hi>will to do good, though evil at the ſame time be preſent;</hi> as it was with the Apoſtle himſelf. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. Conſcience having looked into the Goſpel, underſtands, that God does not deal with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, according to the terms of the Covenant of Works, which had a promiſe of Life only upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfect obedience, but Death was threatned upon the leaſt tranſgreſſion. No, no, they are not now under the Law, but under Grace, and in the new Covenant, ſincerity is accounted and accepted as our perfection before God, through Chriſt Jeſus. Now Conſciences excuſing or defending is of great force and weight. 'Tis not to be checkt by the reproaches of men, nor by the accuſer of the Brethren.</p>
            <p>1. Conſcience <hi>excuſing us is not to be checkt by the reproaches of Men.</hi> How (eager as I hinted before) were <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in their cenſures and accuſations?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44406:32"/> They thought his Religion was but a meer ſhew, and that he had uſed the Form of Godlineſs onely as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for his wickedneſs and injuſtice. Heark how he ſpeaks to them, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 2, 3. <hi>How long will ye vex my Soul, and break me in pieces with words? theſe ten times have ye reproached me, you are not aſhamed that you make your ſelves ſtrange unto me;</hi> and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all, as long as his Conſcience did clear him, his confidence is not ſhaken; and he ſays, <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> (ſurely including himſelf) <hi>ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall wax ſtronger and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> Job 17. 9.</p>
            <p>2. Conſciences <hi>excuſing us, is not to be checkt by Satan the Accuſer of the Brethren.</hi> As <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends did cenſure him, ſo Satan accuſed him of Mercenarineſs and ſelfiſhneſs in his Religion: <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for nought? But put forth thy hand now, and touch what he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy Face.</hi> Theſe were the words of Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 9. 11. But inſtead of this, when all was taken away, <hi>Job</hi> bleſſes the Lord; nay, when his Bone and Fleſh were touched, he ſays, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evil?</hi> Job 2. 10. <hi>Job</hi>'s ſincerity is proved, and approved, is evident to himſelf; and Satan, who 'tis likely enough was buſie to diſturb him, is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a Lyar.</p>
            <p>As the Devil does hide the faults of the profane and ſecure from their eyes, ſo he is continually objecting to the ſincere their failings and imperfections: by his good will he would have us ſee no ſin at all, or nothing elſe but ſin; and from the remainders of Corruption, he is bold to call the Saints Hypocrites, though theſe remainders are never ſo much their burthen. But if Conſcience does give teſtimony, that <hi>they delight in the Law of God after the inward Man,</hi> and that <hi>the evil</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:44406:33"/> 
               <hi>in themſelves, they hate,</hi> and deſire to be <hi>delivered from the Body of ſin and Death:</hi> Notwithſtanding Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's ſlanders, they <hi>give thanks to God becauſe there is now no condemnation to them, being in Christ Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>latter end,</hi> compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> So much for this Office of Conſcience, which is bearing witneſs, both by way of Accuſing and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing.</p>
            <p>5. It follows in the Definition, that 'tis <hi>the Office of Conſcience to Judge, that is, to acquit, or to condemn us.</hi> Judging lies in theſe two things, in abſolving and condemning. The Judge, if Righteous, does acquit the Innocent, does condemn the guilty. Now, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and not condemning, or abſolving, are both aſcribed unto Conſcience, by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. <hi>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things; beloved, if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> There is a kind of a Tribunal erected in the Soul of Man, and after Conſcience has brought in Evidence, and Acted the part of a Witneſs, then it Acts the part of a Judge, and paſſes Sentence, which is two-fold: A Sentence of Abſolution, a Sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſcience as a Judge <hi>paſſes a Sentence of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution;</hi> and, if being rightly informed, Conſcience grounds its Sentence upon Scripture; we may conclude that what <hi>it looſes on Earth is looſed in Heaven.</hi> When Conſcience does declare to the true believer, that he is <hi>juſtified by his Faith, and has Peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> it ſays no more than what God himſelf has plainly ſpoken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. When it declares unto humbled and penitent Souls, who are humbled becauſe they have ſinned and perverted that which is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44406:33"/> right, and ſee that it has not profited them; and who alſo confeſs, and are willing to forſake their Iniquities: when it declares unto ſuch, <hi>that Mercy and abundant Pardon belongs to them;</hi> truly there is plain and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant from Scripture for this Declaration. To be abſolved in the Court of Conſcience is matter of great conſolation, and if Conſcience draw its conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from Scripture-premiſes, it may be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> ſuch as has a firm baſis and Foundation.</p>
            <p>When Conſcience does abſolve, much is contained in this Sentence; it pronounces us free from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo ſentences a reward unto us; it ſhuts Hell, and opens Heaven: for a reward, and the greateſt that can be conceived, (nay, how great cannot be at preſent conceived) is <hi>ſurely</hi> though <hi>freely</hi> promiſed unto them that are ſincere Believers. 'Tis indeed a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Grace, not of Debt;</hi> but becauſe of Grace, therefore the more ſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Therefore it is of Faith that it might be by Grace, to the end the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe might be ſure to all the Seed.</hi> Conſcience in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does Act as Gods Vice-gerent: He himſelf will Judge at laſt as it (if it have light and purity) does Judge at preſent. And thoſe who are now acquitted in the Court of Conſcience, ſhall be alſo abſolved at the great Tribunal. The Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>We have known and believed the Love that God hath to us,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſpeaks <hi>concerning boldneſs in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 John 4. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience, as a Judge, <hi>paſſes a Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> 
               <note n="(i)" place="margin">
                  <l>

               </note> and this Sentence is paſſed upon the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44406:34"/> Impenitent, the Hypocrites, and the Unbelievers; and becauſe the Scripture does condemn theſe, we may truly ſay, that <hi>what Conſcience binds on Earth is bound in Heaven.</hi> I grant indeed, that if Conſcience ſhould paſs Sentence according to the Law of works, every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> (the Holy Child Jeſus excepted) would be condemned. Hark what that Man after Gods own heart ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldſt mark Iniquity, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 2. <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi> His Conſcience ſaw ſo much (and God ſaw a great deal more) of ſin, that in ſtrictneſs of Law and Juſtice it told him he was a condemned Man. But by the Law of Grace they who turn from ſin, and believe in Chriſt, are acquitted. But as for thoſe <hi>who will not come to Chriſt that they may have Life,</hi> but preferr their fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and worldly Luſts, and thoſe things wherewith theſe luſts are gratified, before the Lord of Life and Glory; as they are condemned by the Law of Works, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Law of Grace: Conſcience therefore do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Office, paſſes a dreadful Sentence upon them, and tells them, <hi>that the wrath of God abides on them,</hi> John 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here 'twill be needful to note a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Conſciences condemning a ſinner now, and the Lords condemning him hereafter: that Sentence which Chriſt will pronounce at the laſt day, will be perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unalterable; therefore that Judgment is called <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. There is no appeal from that Tribunal, no reverſing of the Sentence; but thoſe that are then condemned, <hi>Go they muſt, and that immediately into everlaſting puniſhment;</hi> as <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> on the other hand, <hi>into Life Eternal,</hi> Mat. 25. <hi>ult.</hi> But when Conſcience does at preſent condemn a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44406:34"/> ſinner, it does not preclude and ſhut up the door of hope againſt him; its Sentence of condemnation is but conditional, in caſe of continuance and obſtinacy in ſin. But if the unbeliever will believe in Jeſus, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent will mourn for their Iniquities, and turn from them to God, then they ſhall no longer be under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; but <hi>as ſin hath Reigned unto Death, ſo ſhall Grace Reign through Righteouſneſs unto eternal Life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 5. 21.</p>
            <p>I have told you how the Office of Conſcience is to Judge, that is, to acquit or condemn. Now, there are four things that come under this Judgment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Our Actions, our Communication, our Thoughts and Affections, our Eſtate to God-ward.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſcience <hi>judges of our Actions and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and if our Converſation be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel, if we ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation, then it ſays, <hi>Well done.</hi> But if we profeſs to know God, and in Works deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and to every good work Reprobate; Conſcience condemns ſuch doings, and ſays many times in plain terms, that our profeſſion is but meer Mockery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience <hi>judges of our Communication;</hi> though words are commonly called wind, yet Conſcience does not make light of them. It does approve of Holy and Edifying Diſcourſe; when out of the abundance of the Word of God in the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh that which is good, and which may adminiſter grace unto the hearers. <hi>For when they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another, the Lord hearkned and heard it; and a Book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name,</hi> Mal. 3. 16. But Conſcience does condemn corrupt communication, eſpecially where the Tongue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44406:35"/> ſhews it ſelf an unruly evil full of deadly poyſon, by that filthy talking, lying, ſwearing, curſing, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, which proceed out of the mouth. And it does not ſtick to ſay, <hi>The Tongue being not bridled, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is but vain,</hi> James 1. 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſcience <hi>judges of our Thoughts and Affections;</hi> theſe as they ought to be agreeable to Rule, ſo they come under cenſure. The Law is ſo large, that it reaches to our very Thoughts. The wicked man is to forſake <hi>his thoughts</hi> as well as ways, elſe he cannot be a ſincere Convert, nor obtain Mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. Conſcience here is very prying, becauſe theſe internal Acts, theſe thoughts, and deſires, and deſigns, do very much diſcover what the heart is. If wicked thoughts, which are all vain and unprofitable, and likewiſe hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are ſuffered to lodge in the heart, and are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and welcome Gueſts to it, 'tis a ſign the heart is unrenewed: but if theſe thoughts when they ariſe in the heart, are a burthen, are conflicted with, and help is implored againſt them, that God himſelf would ſhew his power, and bring them into Captivity; this ſpeaks the heart ſanctified. If there be a will and deſire in the heart to ſin, though want of Opportunity, or fear of Diſgrace hinder the Act, Conſcience will condemn this as a tranſgreſſion of the Law, which does require in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rectitude, as well as outward Righteouſneſs. And on the other hand, if there be a ſincere deſire and purpoſe to obey the Lord, Conſcience judges this to be Obedience, becauſe God is pleaſed to account it ſo. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid by Faith to have Offered up his Son <hi>Iſaac;</hi> nay, 'tis twice ſaid, that he Offered him up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. when he onely had a purpoſe to have done it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſcience does <hi>judge concerning our State to God-wàrd;</hi> Whether we are or are not reconciled to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44406:35"/> him. If we Live and walk after the Fleſh, if our main care is to provide for the Fleſh, and we account it our greateſt happineſs to fulfill the luſts of it, and we are reſolved to pleaſe our Fleſh, though God be never ſo much Angred; truly Conſcience may then judge our ſtate to be bad. But if we walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit, if our hearts are renewed by the Spirit, and in our lives we are led by him, then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may judge <hi>us to be in Chriſt, and that there is therefore no condemnation to us,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.</p>
            <p>I muſt here Obſerve, that Conſcience may condemn a particular Act, when the Eſtate is not condemned. <hi>David</hi>'s carriage towards <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was very foul, yet his ſtate was not altered from Grace to Nature: <hi>Aſa</hi> his truſting in an Arm of Fleſh, and impriſoning the Prophet that rebuked him, were Acts to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet his State was good, and 'tis ſaid of him, that his heart was perfect with God all his days, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 2, 3. 10. But if the ſtate be bad, all particular Acts muſt needs be bad alſo: If the Tree be corrupt, the Fruit will be like it; for though Conſcience may approve of ſome thing done by a man in a Natural ſtate, as being good for the Matter of it, yet if it Judge aright, it muſt condemn it as evil, in regard of the Manner.</p>
            <p>Thus have I at large explained the Definition which I gave of Conſcience, <hi>That it is a Power of the Soul in Man, whereby we underſtanding the will of God, are impelled to comply with it, and do bear witneſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves and Actions, and accordingly Judge, that is, acquit or condemn our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place, I am to aſſign the Reaſons why the Lord has given unto Man a Conſcience. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are three.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:44406:36"/> 1. Conſcience is given unto Man <hi>that it may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, to put him in mind of God.</hi> To remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God is mans great Duty, he cannot begin too ſoon to do this; therefore, ſays <hi>Solomon, Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy Youth,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 1. and after we have begun, we muſt hold on; for there can never be any good reaſon why the Lord ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. How many Millions of things are there which are appointed to put us in mind of God? <hi>The inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God-head,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. The Sun, the Moon, and all thoſe thouſands of ſhining Stars that our Eyes behold in the Firmament; the Fowls that fly in the Air, the Beaſts of the Earth, the great Sea, and the Creatures that paſs through the paths of it; the Trees, the Plants and Flowers that grow in the Field; are all as ſo many remembrancers to bring God to the thoughts of the Children of Men; ſo that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe if they forget him.</p>
            <p>But beſides all theſe, there is a Monitor within, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their own Breaſts, and that's Conſcience, which will be telling them of God, which will be telling them of his Power and Preſence; and that which Conſcience does inferr from hence, is this; <hi>Let all the Earth fear the Lord, let all the Inhabitants of the World ſtand it awe of him,</hi> Pſal. 33. 8. Conſcience does Comment upon the Creatures; How glorious is that God who made all theſe! and he that made can alſo deſtroy: and therefore his Anger is to be dreaded. He Rules and Governs the World; <hi>He forms the Light, and create<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Darkneſs; he makes Peace, and creates Evil;</hi> and therefore ſurely 'tis wiſdom to pleaſe him, and the height of madneſs to provoke him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience is given to Man, <hi>that it may put him</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:44406:36"/> 
               <hi>in mind of his own great Intereſt and concern, which is to ſecure his Soul, and to provide for Eternity.</hi> 'Tis not without reaſon that the Natural Man is called <hi>fleſh</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. The fleſh does ſo prevail againſt the Soul, as to take up his whole time and care. His great enquiries are, <hi>What ſhall I eat? what ſhall I drink? and wherewithall ſhall I be cloathed?</hi> Mat. 6. 31. And thus he would live, as if he had no Soul to ſave or loſe, if Conſcience did not put him in mind of that precious Jewel which he is intruſted with, and bring to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Conſcience tells us of a Soul which is of greateſt value, and which is in greateſt danger. It calls a Man a Fool for ſaying, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, thou haſt Goods laid up for many Years.</hi> Sumptuous Fare cannot ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Souls hunger, the moſt delicious Wines cannot quench the Souls thirſt; nor purple and fine Linnen cover the Souls Nakedneſs. Theſe things onely grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſenſes, but ſome thing that's higher, and more durable muſt be lookt after, that may be a proper and ſutable good unto the Soul of Man, which is of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Immortal Nature; and if you ask what that is? I Anſwer, the Eternal and All-ſufficient God. <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Magnus es Domine, &amp; laudabilis valde, magna virtus tua, &amp; ſapientiae tuae non eſt numerus. Tu excitas ut laudare te delectet; quia feciſti nos ad te, &amp; inquietum eſt cor noſtrum donec requieſcet in te. Augustin.</hi> Confeſ. l. 1. c. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſcience is given to Man, <hi>that it may tell him of his Duty, and urge him to the performance of it.</hi> Such is the corruption of Mans Nature, <hi>that he hates Inſtruction, and is apt to caſt the Law of God behind his</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44406:37"/> 
               <hi>back Pſal.</hi> 50. 17. but <hi>Conſcience</hi> obſerves what that Law requires, and ſayes 'tis Holy, juſt and good, and therefore does proteſt againſt the Tranſgreſſing of it. <hi>Conſcience</hi> tells us that God is a better maſter than ſin and Satan; He rewards his Servants with Life and Joy, but They theirs with Eternal Death and VVoe. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of all men, even the Heathens, that there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>The work of the Law written in their Hearts, Rom.</hi> 2. 15. The <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men are the Tables where the Laws of God are written, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> is continually opening theſe Tables, and commanding men to read and do their duty. I grant indeed that there is a <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law in the Heart,</hi> which is promiſed in the new Covenant, which all men have not, but is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Believers, and when this promiſe is made good to any, not only are their minds enlightned but their hearts changed; there is a ſutableneſſe between their renewed wills, and the Laws of God, ſo that now they are deſirous to keep them, as before they were violently bent to break them. But the writing of the Law in the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is commune, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands this Law that it may preſſe obedience to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſcience is given to man <hi>that it may warn and caution him againſt the Tempter.</hi> It is as it were the Watchman which gives notice of this Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Of all the powers of the Soul the Devil does leaſt like this, for it does moſt withſtand him. When Satan promiſes great matters to thoſe whom he tempts, Conſcience ſayes that a Lyar is not to be believed. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will not give what he promiſes, or if he does, what he gives had better not be given, becauſe 'tis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſinners hurt. '<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the gifts of Enemies are no gifts at all, or worſe then none.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44406:37"/> When Satan pretends to aim never ſo much at our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or advancement, or delight, Conſcience ſees the Snake in the Graſs, and tells, that the Devil is a Murtherer, and in every temptation is carrying on a murtherous deſign againſt us. When Satan comes with the ſweet cup of ſinful pleaſures, Conſcience ſayes, <hi>Drink not, for there is rank poyſon in it.</hi> When Satan transforms himſelf into a Friend, and ſeems to conſult our ſafety, and eaſe, and gain, Conſcience cryes out, <hi>Take heed, a Murtherer is neer you,</hi> and therefore yield not to him, give him no admiſſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſcience is given unto Man <hi>that it may give Teſtimony to the Word of God, and ſide with it againſt all carnal reaſonings &amp; Affections.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus had to do with Hearers which were captious, which were ſtill ready to ſtart their frivolous objections againſt himſelf, and againſt his Doctrine, as when he ſaid, <hi>if I be lifted up from the Earth,</hi> that is Crucified, <hi>I will draw all men to me;</hi> they preſently object, <hi>Chriſt abideth for ever, and how then can he be lifted up? Joh.</hi> 12. 32. 34. Now he does not anſwer directly to their objection, but applies himſelf to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and tells them, 'twas but <hi>a little while that the light was to be with them,</hi> and therefore ſays he, <hi>Walk while ye have the Light, leſt Darkneſs come upon you; for he that walketh in Darkneſs knoweth not whither he goeth, v.</hi> 35. So the Apoſtle did <hi>commend himſelf to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans Conſcience in the ſight of God;</hi> and adds, <hi>if our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 2, 3. Conſcience is more ready to cloſe with Truth; the Affections hang off becauſe Truth does thwart them while they remain carnal. The Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Jewes, many of them, were convinced that Jeſus Chriſt was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but their Hearts were againſt following of him, <hi>for they loved</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:44406:38"/> 
               <hi>the Praiſe of men more than the Praiſe God, Joh.</hi> 12. 42, 43. When a corrupt will ſayes concerning a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, This is an hard ſaying, 'tis too ſtrict: <hi>Conſcience</hi> will confeſſe, 'tis juſt and good to be obeyed. When a carnal mind phanſies abſurdities <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prodigioſus certe humani ingenii furor, quòd injustitiae potius Deum inſimulat, quam ut ſe coarguat caecitatis.</hi> Calv. in Epiſt. ad Rom. c. 9. v. 14.</note> in the myſteries of the Goſpel, and ſays, <hi>how can theſe things be? Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is modeſt, and replies, that God is True, and mans underſtanding is ſhallow, and therefore man is to believe what God ſpeaks, for certain, though he cannot fully comprehend it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Conſcience</hi> is given unto man, <hi>that this may ſide with the Lord when he paſſes Judgment at the great approaching day.</hi> This day is called a day <hi>of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his Righteous judgement,</hi> and whatever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments he does ſentence the Sons of Men unto, they will not be able to charge him with the leaſt injuſtice. Their own <hi>Conſciences</hi> will acknowledge every crime that the Lord then ſhall lay to their charge; and when they are thrown down into that Lake which burns with Fire and Brimſtone, <hi>Conſcience</hi> will be ready to ſpeak the ſame language which you read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 5. 7. <hi>Thou art Righteous O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt thus judged. Even ſo Lord God Almighty, True and Righteous are thy judgments.</hi>

Every mouth

            <p n="1">1. If there be a <hi>Conſcience</hi> in Man, learn from hence, <hi>that there is a God.</hi> There are many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove this great fundamental Truth: the Creatures would never have had a Being unleſs God had given a Being to them. <note n="(n)" place="margin">If ever there had been altogether nothing, there never could have been any thing.</note> His works do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare both his Being and his Glory. But if we look into our ſelves, we ſhall find this Truth writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten plain upon our own ſouls. VVe are (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſo full of ſelf-love, that we ſhould not at all regard our own knowledge of our miſdoings, if Conſcience were not convinced of the Godhead, whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we cannot poſſibly eſcape. The Pſalmiſt indeed tells us that <hi>the fool hath ſaid in his Heart there is no God, Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. but in this he rather ſpeaks what his wiſhesare, than what he is really perſwaded of. For it has been obſerved concerning thoſe who have been moſt Atheiſtical, that <hi>Conſcience</hi> has prickt and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them ſometimes; and the dread of God has (when they have heard it Thunder, or have been in ſome great calamity,) returned upon them.</p>

'Tis evident by the light of Nature that the Soul is immortal. Many of the Heathens dreaded ſin upon this account, leſt their Souls after death ſhould be puniſht for it. But in the Scripture this Truth is evidently delivered. Chriſt ſays, <hi>Man cannot kill the Soul, though he can kill the Body, Mat.</hi> 10. 28. But if the ſoul did dye or ſleep with the Body, then Man would be able to do the one as well

Conſcience alſo is of admirable Uſe, but moſt are troubled at it, as if 'twere a thing ſent on purpoſe to torment them before the time. But by ſeveral Arguments I ſhall make it evident, that you have great cauſe to be thankful, that God has placed Conſciences in you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſcience is ſuch a Power <hi>as ſcaped but in mans fall of any other Faculty.</hi> The will of Man is full of enmity againſt God, and therefore his heart is ſaid to <hi>be deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17. 9. But though there is no good or rectitude in the heart, yet there is ſome Light remaining in the Conſcience, and though the heart be extreamly evil, willing to deceive, willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet the Conſcience has ſome kind of tenderneſs and faithfulneſs left in it, unleſs by long cuſtome in ſin it be made ſenſeleſs and ſtupid. I readily yield that Conſcience is corrupted alſo in a great meaſure by the Fall; the Apoſtle tells, us that <hi>unbelievers mind and Conſcience is defiled,</hi> Titus 1. 15. There is a great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44406:41"/> deal of difference between the Conſcience of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocence, and the Conſcience of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man. Conſcience is leſs acquainted with the will of God than it was: It has not that Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to command Obedience that once it had; it is prone, (eſpecially in ſome things,) to be erroneous, and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to urge to ſin inſtead of Duty: it does not with ſuch ſtrength and vigour oppoſe temptation, as it ought. But yet ſtill 'tis a great Mercy that Conſcience does ſo much as it does; the light of it might have been totally extinguiſhed, and the Lord might have ſuffered us to have run full-ſpeed in our wicked ways to Deſtruction, without any Monitor within to check or controul us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience <hi>takes part with God againſt ſin and Satan.</hi> 'Twas the ſaying of an Heathen Poet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Conſcience is a God unto all Mortal Men;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe it ſides with God, and aſſents to the equity of his Commands. It declaims againſt ſin, and calls the Devil an Enemy who tempts to the commiſſion of it, and calls the ſinner a Fool and Mad-man for yielding: it conſents unto the Law of God that it is good, and is not ſatisfied, if God be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if his Law be tranſgreſſed. Oh, let's be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Conſcience, for by endeavouring to hinder our departing from God, and our provoking him to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; It does conſult our Peace, our Profit, our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and would have us lifted up above thoſe ſlaviſh fears, which are ſo great a torment to the Soul reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon its evil doings. <note n="(q)" place="margin">

Conſcience <hi>takes part with the Soul againſt the Fleſh.</hi> It cannot patiently endure that a vile Body ſhould be onely minded, and a precious Soul totally neglected. How often does Conſcience upbraid us with this? That if our Bodies lack Food, we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſollicitous to provide for them, and prevent their ſtarving: but our Souls may want Spiritual food Days, Moneths, Years together, and yet we are not concerned. That if our Bodies want Cloathing, we are aſhamed to be ſeen, and are not contented till we have gotten Raiment to cover their Nakedneſs: But our Souls may be <hi>Naked, Wretched, and Miſerable:</hi> And this Nakedneſs is perceived by the Holy Eye of God, yet we bluſh not, nor apply our ſelves to Chriſt for the white Robe of his Righteouſneſs to cover them. Finally, That if our Bodies are Diſtempered, we ſend for a Phyſitian, and are eager to be Cured: But our Souls may Labour under many Spiritual Plagues; as Hardneſs, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Concupiſcence, which Diſtempers, if not healed, will prove Mortal in the worſt ſence; and yet Chriſt the Phyſitian of Souls is not valued, neither do we cry to be healed, but ſeem rather to be fond of our Maladies. <note n="(r)" place="margin">

            <p n="4">4. Conſcience, of <hi>all other Powers, does ſtruggle moſt to prevent our Ruine:</hi> or rather when our other
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44406:42"/> Powers are forward to promote our Deſtruction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience endeavours to hinder it. Man is his own chief Enemy, and has the greateſt hand in his own undoing. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9. If you look into Scripture, you will find how ſinners are bent to tranſgreſs, they will not be made clean; all that is in them, (Conſcience excepted) joyns together to make them miſerable. <hi>Their eyes are full of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and cannot ceaſe from ſin,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14. <hi>Their Tongue is a fire, a World of Iniquity, that it defileth the whole Body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> James 3. 6. <hi>Their Throat is an open Sepulchre, the poyſon of Aſpes is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lips,</hi> Rom. 3. 13. They work Iniquity with both hands earneſtly, and their Feet are ſwift in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to evil. Their Wills are exceeding obſtinate and perverſe; they are reſolved to burn in Hell before they will turn from ſin; <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>They will not be perſwaded to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, though one ſhould riſe from the Dead,</hi> and tell them of thoſe unquenchable and furious Flames in which the damned are tormented, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> Their Affections are ſtrong and vehement for Sin and Vanity, they love ſin better than themſelves, and a vain periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World before an infinitely better and enduring Subſtance. Thus all in Man conſpires unto his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: onely Conſcience oppoſes and warns him of his danger, and urges him not to be a Devil to himſelf, nor in the worſt ſence to be a <hi>ſelf-murtherer,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Soul murtherer.</hi>
            </p>

But their Conſciences are for us, and ſo much the more for us, by how much more faithfully we diſcharge our Duty. The ſharpeſt rebukes Conſcience will ſay are needful, and will tell the ſinner, that <hi>he that hates Reproof, is Brutiſh, Prov.</hi> 12. 1.

It ſets the Lord before us, and charges us as we value his loving kindneſſe which is better than Life, as we value fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, that we endeavour to do that which is good in his ſight. And as we would eſcape his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his ſmoaking jealouſie which will utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us; that we beware of that which is worſt of evils, ſinning againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider the Power of Conſcience,</hi> if we take Power for <hi>Authority,</hi> God has given great Authority unto the Conſcience; And a Man muſt rather diſobey Kings and Emperours then diſobey Conſcience. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> commanded the three Children to Worſhip the Golden Image that he had ſet up; Conſcience commanded them to refuſe to Worſhip it. They obey Conſcience, and rather than Conſcience ſhould fly in their faces for ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, they venture to be caſt into a fiery furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. If we take Power for <hi>Ability, Conſcience</hi> is a thing of greater force and ſtrength. If it be good, how can it ſweeten any condition though in it ſelf never ſo cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous! but if <hi>Conſcience</hi> be bad, 'tis ſufficient to put gall and bitterneſſe into all your Comforts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you heed <hi>Conſcience, 'tis the way to have you and your Conſciences agree together.</hi> Conſcience will dwell with you and you cannot help it, Oh therefore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44406:44"/> hearken to it, and ſatisfie it, for this will be much for your own peace and ſatisfaction. There is a twofold Peace which it highly concerns us to look after, <hi>Peace above,</hi> and <hi>Peace within.</hi> Peace above with God we ſhould be ſollicitous about, there is no contending with Him that is Almighty. <hi>Let the Potſherds ſtrive with the Potſherds of the Earth, but wo unto him that ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with his Maker,</hi> Eſa. 45. 9. How earneſt then ſhould we be, that being juſtified by Faith we may have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And next unto peace with God, we ſhould endeavour after peace within, even peace of Conſcience; and if we hearken and do what an enlightned <hi>Conſcience</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and walk before God in Truth. <hi>Conſcience</hi> will ſpeak Peace, and that peace it will be true.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place I am to open what a good <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is, and before I ſpeak to this, it will not be amiſs to premiſe theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſcience was good, very good in Adam, when he was firſt made, and ſo continued while he remained in the ſtate of innocency.</hi> Oh the Light, and Grace, and Peace that was in <hi>Adams</hi> Soul, when he was newly come out of his Creators hand! There was a far ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Paradiſe within, than that <hi>Eden</hi> in which he was placed. When the Lord was about to form Man, he ſaid <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeneſs, Gen.</hi> 1. 26. and ver. 27. it follows, <hi>ſo God created Man in his own Image,</hi> nay 'tis doubled, <hi>in the Image of God created he him.</hi> As Man did reſſemble God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſſe, ſo he did reſemble him in Peace and Bleſſedneſs. Man was made upright, there was nothing in him, that either God or Conſcience did diſapprove of. His Purity was without ſpot, his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without any mixture of ſin, his joy was without grief or remorſe, his peace calm, without the leaſt ſtorm or trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:44406:46"/> 2. <hi>The Conſcience of Man was defiled and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his fall.</hi> Sin did throw the Apoſtate Angels quite to Hell; <hi>the chains of Darkneſſe</hi> in which thoſe evil Spirits are, may well be interpreted partly to be their guilty and tormenting Conſciences, which they can never be freed from, but will keep them trembling till the great day. And truly ſin did throw Man down to the very brink of Hell. Who can conceive that horrour which was in <hi>Adams</hi> Soul till <hi>the promiſed Seed</hi> was ſpoken of, till he had an intimation of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah?</hi> VVe are not chiefly to take notice of the act of eating the forbidden fruit, but <hi>Adams</hi> Mind in Eating. How great was his Pride! he would have been as God: how curſed his unbelief! he makes God a Lyar, and credits the Father of Lies before him. Nay, ſince this Tree was appointed for trial, whether man would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue good, or become evil, his Eating of it ſhewed a contempt of that Covenant, and promiſe of Life which God had made with him. By all this how was his Conſcience polluted! <hi>Adam where art thou?</hi> ſays God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 9. Thou wert neer me once, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art thou run away? I placed thee in an happy ſtate, but whither art thou fallen; into what depths of miſery haſt thou plunged thy ſelf?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Conſcience of every natural Man in the World is Evil.</hi> Since all are conceived in ſin, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, it follows that the nature of Man is corrupted, there is no part or power in man, but the contagion of ſin has reached. <hi>In me that is in my fleſh, there dwells no good thing,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. Now our Lord calls all natural men; Fleſh: <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, John</hi> 3. 6. And if in the Fleſh there dwels no good thing, Surely a good Conſcience is not to be found in any carnal man breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I affirmed before, that Conſcience has ſcaped
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44406:47"/> beſt of any Faculty, in the Fall, and yet it muſt needs be acknowledged, that this has been bruiſed, this has been Wounded.</p>
            <p>The Light which Conſcience now has, if compared with what it had before the Fall, is no more than the light of a Candle compared with the Sun: 'tis Night ſtill though the Candle burns; and onely the Sun can make it Day. Something of God and of his Will, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience knows; but how inſufficient is that knowledge! Conſcience urges Men to Duty, but 'tis Natural to it to permit them to place a confidence in what they do, as if by their Obedience ſome amends were made for their tranſgreſſions; and this is a great fault in it, and a very grand Impediment unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Goſpel, which informs us, that <hi>we muſt Rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the Fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3. 3. How dull and ſluggiſh is Conſcience Naturally in the Executing of its Office! As <hi>Eli</hi> ſpake ſomething to his Sons, but faintly; and therefore he is blamed exceedingly, that his Sons <hi>made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi> So the ungodly make themſelves vile, and Conſcience does not reſtrain them: 'tis not ſo peremptory in its prohibitions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; ſo fierce in its accuſations, neither does it Judge with ſuch Authority as it ought.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis poſſible and uſual for a Conſcience to appear good when 'tis ſtark naught.</hi> Though all Gold gliſters, yet all is not Gold that gliſters. All Grace ſhines, yet all is not Grace that ſhines. There is a Conſcience, that is ſo miſtaken, <hi>as to call good evil, and evil good, as to put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs,</hi> Iſa. 5. 20. And if evil be called good, and darkneſs light; how eagerly, and reſolutely will evil be Acted, and the Works of Darkneſs be engaged in! The Jews when they Perſecuted the Son of God, thought they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44406:47"/> did God good Service: Here was a Conſcience that ſeemed Zealous for God, but was indeed againſt him. Mens Conſciences in many caſes entertain high ſelf-conceits, where there is no ground, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 12. <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs. So Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> did ſay, <hi>I am Rich, and increaſed with Goods, and have need of nothing:</hi> But this was the Ignorance and unfaithfulneſs of their Conſcience. Chriſt ſays to them, <hi>Thou knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor and blind, and naked,</hi> Rev. 3. 17.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis neceſſary that the Spirit work a ſaving change before the Conſcience of any can be truly good:</hi> this is to be found onely in them that are New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. None can be ſaid to have good Conſciences, that are under the Power of Satan, that ſerve divers Luſts and Pleaſures, that walk after the Fleſh, that are workers of Iniquity; but ſuch are all who never were regenerated by the Spirit. 'Tis the <hi>Blood of Chriſt muſt purge the Conſcience from dead works.</hi> But none can be ſaid to be in Chriſt, nor to have a purged Conſcience but they who have been New created, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Therefore if any Man be in Chriſt he is a New Creature, Old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become New.</hi> I grant that Conſcience may be awakened in many unregenerate ſinners, but the bare awakening of it is not ſufficient to prove it good; for then in Hell there would be Excellent Conſciences, for all there are awakened throughly. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakenings, Conſcience in the ungodly continues evil, as long as the guilt of ſin remains unremoved, and the Soul is ſtill under the Dominion and Power of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Conſciences of the regenerate are not good, in reſpect of Legal Perfection and Exactneſs.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> before his Apoſtacy, was able to reach this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44406:48"/> Exactneſs, which the Law required; he was able to Obey the Law of God without Offending in a tittle, Chriſt alſo the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> did fulfill the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Tranſgreſſion all his days. He was like unto his Brethren in other regards, <hi>but ſin is excepted,</hi> Heb. 4. 15. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>Such an High-Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came us, who is Holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens.</hi> But truly the beſt of Saints fall ſhort. Surely they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Law of God, that imagine they are able perfectly to Obey it; it may juſtly be ſuſpected that they put ſhort gloſſes upon it, and then fancy they fulfill it: but queſtionleſs they are ignorant of its ſtrictneſs and Spirituality.</p>
            <p>As 'tis ſaid of God himſelf, <hi>that he is of purer eyes than to behold Evil, and cannot look upon Iniquity,</hi> Habak. 1. 13. So it may be ſaid of his Law, 'tis purer than to allow any evil, than to approve of the leaſt Iniquity. No Conſcience therefore, in a Legal ſence, can be affirmed to be good, for the Holy Ghoſt does not ſtick to ſay, <hi>There is not a Juſt man upon Earth that does good and ſins not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 20. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Saints ſee ſin but in part, therefore <hi>David</hi> crys out, <hi>Cleanſe me from ſecret ſins, who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Errors?</hi> Pſal. 19. 12. and Pſal. 139. 23, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> And as the Conſciences of the beſt are capable of more light than they have, ſo more purity and tenderneſs may alſo be attained.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Conſcience may be good according to the Law of Grace, though ſin is not totally purged away.</hi> This very Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> which ſays, he had a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God, does yet ſay, <hi>Not as though I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>attained, or were already perfect,</hi> Phil. 3. 12. Nay, he does acknowledge that <hi>ſin did dwell in him,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <hi>of a Law in his Members,</hi> and crys out, <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this death?</hi> Rom. 7. 20, 23, 24. Conſcience is good in a Goſpel-ſence, though ſin remain, as long as it does not Reign in us, and we are no longer willing to Obey it in the Luſts of it. Now, if you ask me, in what regard Conſcience is good notwithſtanding ſome remainders of evil: I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſcience is good comparatively;</hi> how vaſt a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Saints and Sinners! How careful the one, how careleſs the other! How are the former afraid of offending God! how are the latter preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and bold! How are their Hearts ſet in them to do evil! When <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be a Juſt Man, and Perfect in his Generation,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. This is hinted, that he was Juſt, compared with the men of his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and his Righteouſneſs was the more to be admired, ſince he kept himſelf unpolluted by their wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience may be ſaid <hi>to be good ſincerely,</hi> when in the ſpirit of a man <hi>there is no guile,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 2. When there is no ſin, but the ſoul conſents to be delivered from it, and no Grace but the ſoul deſires to be enriched with it; and no Command, but 'tis willing to Obey it, and where it falls ſhort 'tis grieved; and becauſe it has not attained, therefore <hi>'tis continually preſſing towards the Mark,</hi> and <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>

I ſhall therefore in ſeveral particulars ſhew wherein the goodneſs of it does conſiſt; and alſo as I go along, which will be highly needful, direct you how this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be attained to in every part of it.</p>
            <p>1. The goodneſs of Conſcience lies in its <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being rightly informed.</hi> Conſcience is to be a guide, but that is not to be called a good guide, which is either blind, or does miſtake. <hi>If the Light that is in thee be Darkneſs, how great is that Darkneſs? Mat.</hi> 6. 23. Upon this ſcore Wiſdom and Knowledge in Scripture are ſo much commended; and we are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently commanded to ſeek, and to get Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44406:50"/> 
               <hi>Job</hi> 28. 18, 19 <hi>No mention ſhall be made of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or of Pearls, for the price of Wiſdom is above Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies. The topaz of</hi> Aethiopia <hi>cannot equal it, neither ſhall it be valued with pure Gold.</hi> So, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Happy is the Man that findeth Wiſdom, and the Man that getteth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; for the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of it is better than the Merchandize of Silver, and the gain thereof than fine Gold. She is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the principal thing, therefore get Wiſdom, and with all thy gettings get underſtanding.</hi> 'Tis confeſſed that Conſcience may be enlightned, and yet remain bad, no improvement being made of the Light of it; but yet this is certain, that Conſcience cannot be good unleſs it be enlightned. As we ſay, there may be Knowledge without ſaving Faith, but not ſaving Faith without Knowledge: So here, there may be Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without this goodneſs of Conſcience, but not a good Conſcience without this Ingredient of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>But you will ask me, what kind of Knowledge is that which is in a good Conſcience? I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The knowledge of a good Conſcience <hi>is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, as that it underſtands all things that be of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be believed and practiſed, in Order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> No Fundamental Article of Faith, or Duty of Chriſtianity but is known. The Conſcience cannot be good unleſs there be <hi>a knowledge of the onely true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> John 17. 3. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are acquainted with what the Lord requires of us; namely, to Repent of ſin, to believe in Jeſus, to do juſtly, to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with our God. Though that Promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>When the Spirit of Truth is come, he ſhall guide you into all Truth,</hi> may have a ſpecial reference to the Apoſtles,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44406:50"/> who were to publiſh the Goſpel unto all Nations, and ſo had need to be certainly informed themſelves; yet 'tis applicable unto all Believers, they ſhall by the Spirit be led into all Truth Neceſſary to be known and Obeyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Knowledge of a good Conſcience <hi>is true, in Oppoſition unto Error and Falſhood.</hi> 'Tis a Beam which comes <hi>from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning,</hi> James 1. 17. All true Wiſdom is from above; 'tis through the Precepts of the Lord, that Conſcience does get a right Underſtanding; and hence it comes to paſs, that falſe ways are diſcovered and abhorred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 104. 'Tis very ſad to have an Erroneous Conſcience, for in this caſe Conſcience does back the Devils commands with God's Authority. An Erring Conſcience does bind the Perſon, I confeſs, ſo that he ſins if he does not heed his Conſcience; for Interpretatively, he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Will of God; for Conſcience, though it command what is evil, yet requires it as that which is conceived to be good, and what God has commanded. He that ſhall injure or affront a Private Perſon, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the King, is juſtly cenſured to have Acted againſt the King, becauſe, ſuppoſe the King had really been in his reach, he would have affronted him. So, he that goes againſt Conſcience which errs when it tells him, This is the Will of God, would go againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuppoſing it were really the Lords Will. So, that 'tis certain the Perſon is bound by an Erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: But truly, to ſpeak properly, there cannot be an Obligation unto the Error of the Conſcience, there cannot be an Obligation to the Evil that an Erroneous Conſcience puts us upon. All proper Obligation is from the Law and Will of God, but the Word of God does forbid all evil; nay, forbids the leaſt Evil to be done, whatever good is likely to follow upon the doing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44406:51"/> of it. <hi>Their damnation is juſt who do evil that good may come, Rom.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>A man whoſe Conſcience erreth is under a miſerable kind of neceſſity of ſinning; if he goes againſt his Conſcience he ſins, becauſe Conſcience commands him in Gods name; if he go according to his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he ſins, becauſe Conſcience is miſtaken, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what God has really prohibited and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. What great enemies are Seducers and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets unto Conſcience? they Preach up their Errors as the Truths of Chriſt, and hereby they mis-inform and enſnare ſouls; and truly where there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and unwary boldneſs as to errour, as if there were no danger of it, or in it, a thouſand to one but Conſcience may quickly be corrupted. But here it may be demanded, what ſhall a man do whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience errs? I anſwer 'tis his duty to put away ſuch a Conſcience, and to intreat the Lord that he may be rightly informed. A good Conſcience is thus inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſpeaks to us nothing but what is true in the Name of the Lord. It does <hi>beware</hi> of <hi>falſe</hi> Prophets, and will not <hi>follow ſtrangers,</hi> 'tis a great enemy <hi>to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſtrange Doctrines, Heb.</hi> 13. 9. It diſlikes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, will-worſhip, and all humane inventions, its fear of God is not taught by the precepts of men: but what is from <hi>heaven,</hi> that it minds: what God would have done that it enquires after, and is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. If you ask me here whether a good mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may not err? I anſwer, in ſome ſmaller things it may, but this erring is no part of the goodneſs of his Conſcience, and therefore both himſelf and others ſhould endeavour his being brought to a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The knowledge of a good Conſcience is <hi>certain, in oppoſition unto dubiouſneſs;</hi> 'tis grounded upon that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44406:51"/> Revelation which the Lord has made of his own will. A good Conſcience looks into, and ſearches the Holy Scriptures, and is fully aſſured that what is made known, either as a matter of Faith or Practice, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Mind of God; for all <hi>Scripture is of Divine inſpiration,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. This certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Apoſtle does emphatically expreſs, when he calls it <hi>The Riches of the full aſſurance of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Col.</hi> 2. 2. Conſcience which is good, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both of the myſteries of Faith, and the duties of Religion, and entertains the one, and urges unto the doing of the other.</p>
            <p>This certainty is oppoſed unto dubiouſneſs, when the Conſcience through infirmity and weakneſs is at a loſs, and knowes not what to do in ſome caſes: Juſt as a man Travelling meets with two ways and knows not which is the right, when he turns to the right hand he doubts, and ſo turns to the left, and when he turns to the left Hand, he doubts whether that will bring him to his journies end, and ſo is ready to turn back to the right again. Saints themſelves may thus be in doubt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; but this is no part of the goodneſſe of their Conſcience; but an Argument onely of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And in this caſe as the Lord is earneſtly to be ſought to <hi>make their way plain before them,</hi> So they are to <hi>follow the Footſteps of the Flock,</hi> and in thoſe doubtful matters, to obſerve which way the Holieſt and beſt, both of Miniſters and Saints do go, and to accompany them. When the Spouſe ſayes, <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l me (O thou whom my Soul loves) where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy Flocks to reſt at Noon: for why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide by the Flocks of thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?</hi> Chriſt anſwers, If thou would'ſt know, <hi>O thou faireſt among Women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the Flock, and feed thy Kids beſide the Shepherds</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:44406:52"/> 
               <hi>Tents, Cant.</hi> 1. 7, 8. and So <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>That thou mayeſt walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the Righteous.</hi> Miſapprehend me not, I do not make this a general rule, that we are in all things to follow good men. But where the Conſcience doubts on both hands, and is afraid it ſins which ſide ſoever it takes. In this caſe the Footſteps of the Flock are to be minded, and we muſt keep cloſe to the Shepherds Tents; and being humble and teachable, this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and dubiouſneſs may be cured; and the Lord may bleſs means of inſtruction, to make us ſee that plainly, which before we were in the dark about.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The knowledge of a Conſcience is <hi>ſatisfying; in oppoſition unto ſcrupulouſneſſe.</hi> As wiſdome is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, ſo alſo delightful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>When wiſdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into thy Heart, and Knowledge is pleaſant to thy Soul.</hi> As there is great contentment when the will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and enjoys <hi>good,</hi> ſo there is great ſatisfaction when the underſtanding and Conſcience have found out and do entertain <hi>Truth.</hi> But on the other hand ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs is very tormenting. Theſe ſcruples are things which ariſe from weak and ſometimes from no ground at all, and the Lord does permit Believers themſelves to be exerciſed with them, to correct for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins againſt Conſcience, and alſo to try their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenderneſs. In Melancholy perſons theſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are moſt frequent, and in them whoſe knowledge is but ſmall.</p>
            <p>A ſcurpulous Conſcience differs from a doubting, in that a doubting is afraid <hi>on both hands,</hi> a ſcrupulous is ſatisfied <hi>on one part,</hi> but is ſollicitous and full of fear in reference to the other. He had a ſcrupulous Conſcience that did queſtion the lawfulneſs of <hi>eating all things,</hi> but he was ſatisfied concerning <hi>eating Herbs, Rom.</hi> 14. 2. Now this ſcrupulouſneſs is really a fault as well as a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44406:52"/> vexation of Conſcience, and therefore by well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things; and diligent looking into the word; and not making more ſins than the word declares to be ſo; and by underſtanding better our Chriſtian liberty; we ſhould endeavour to be rid of our needleſs ſcruples. Theſe ſcruples if we take not heed, will be ſo much attended to, as that weightier matters may be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they will make the ſervice of the Lord leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable: and Satan will get advantage to repreſent his yoak as the more heavy and burthenſome. But when Conſcience is freed from theſe, 'tis juſt as if a ſtone ſhould be taken out of our ſhooe; <note n="(y)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Conſcientia ſcrupuloſa nomen habet à ſcrupo, qui eſt lapillus in calceo hominem laedens, &amp; in inceſſu impediens.</hi> Bald. <hi>de Conſc.</hi> l. 1. c. 10.</note> with greater eaſe, and chearfulneſs we ſhall go, nay Run in the way of Gods Commandments.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The knowledge of a good Conſcience <hi>is opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and incites to practice.</hi> That paſſage of our Lord is deeply engraven upon a good and honeſt heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> Barely to know will not make us happy, nay, 'twill make us more miſerable, becauſe more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. Though a good Conſcience eyes the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſufferings of Chriſt, and there is an hope of acceptation and pardon only upon that account; yet becauſe by Faith the Law is not made void, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, therefore it urges obedience to the Law. The Covenant of Grace having firſt ſaid, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> in a qualified ſence alſo ſayes, <hi>Do this and Live.</hi> Sincere obedience is required, or elſe Life will never be obtained, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandements that</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:44406:53"/> 
               <hi>they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into the City.</hi> The Light of a good Conſcience urges to the caſting off the works of Darkneſſe and to walk circumſpectly, and to do this without delay. As the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when their firſt-born were deſtroyed, haſtned the Iſraelites to be gone; for ſaid they <hi>we be all Dead men:</hi> So Conſcience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens us to part with ſuch a deadly thing as ſin, and bids us not delay to keep Gods Righteous Judgements.</p>
            <p>You ſee what kind of knowledge is that of a good Conſcience: but here the great enquiry will be, how may Conſcience be well informed, and this kind of knowledge obtained?</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Conſcience may be well informed, <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be well ſearched.</hi> Holy men of old digged in this Mine for knowledge, and found their labour well beſtowed. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul; the Teſtimony of the Lord is Sure making Wiſe the ſimple, Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, There is more of God revealed and made known in a leaf of the Bible, than in the whole Book of Nature. <hi>Horace</hi> does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Homer</hi> the Writer of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, upon this account. <hi>Qui quid ſit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non; Pleniùs &amp; meliùs Chryſippo &amp; Crantore dixit.</hi> Becauſe he tells beſt of all what is Fair and Lovely, and what is Foul and Filthy, what is Profitable, and what is Hurtful. But what are <hi>Homers</hi> Writings, compared with the Holy Scripture? This, this, does moſt fully inform the Conſcience what is good and what is evill, and what will do us good, and what will be evil and injurious to us.</p>
            <p>The Scripture muſt be <hi>ſearched,</hi> we muſt look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſurface, Truth ſometimes lies deep, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> uſes that expreſſion. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. 5. <hi>If</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44406:53"/> 
               <hi>thou ſeekeſt her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her, as for hid Treaſures, then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God.</hi> As the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contains ſuch a full diſcovery of the Will of God, ſo there are ſeveral promiſes made, that it ſhall be a guide unto the Conſcience, and direct us in a ſafe way, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22, 23. <hi>When thou goeſt, it ſhall lead thee; when thou ſleepeſt, it ſhall keep thee; when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee; for the Commandement is a lamp, and the Law is Light, and the Reproofs of Inſtruction are the Way of Life.</hi> So Prov. 4. 12. 13. <hi>Take faſt hold of Inſtruction; let her not go, for ſhe is thy Life; when thou goeſt thy ſteps ſhall not be ſtraitned; and when thou runneſt thou ſhalt not ſtumble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That Conſcience may be well informed; <hi>The Spirit of God muſt be begged for.</hi> Conſcience does very much imitate the Spirit. Does the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for ſin? ſo does Conſcience. Does the Spirit Comfort? ſo does Conſcience. Does the Spirit move us unto our duty? ſo does Conſcience. And indeed 'tis by the aid and Grace of the Spirit that Conſcience does all this. And as Conſcience is a weak thing; So alſo a dark thing without the Spirit. Hark to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty; but we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> The Spirit in the glaſs of the Goſpel, does give the Mind and Conſcience ſuch a ſight of the Beauty of Holineſs, as that there is a change wrought in the very Heart; the Image of God, which does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Righteouſneſs and True Holineſs, is inſtamped upon it. We ſhould with great earneſtneſs ask the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for as he is the Spirit of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſo alſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Truth,</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom and Revelation,</hi> who alone
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44406:54"/> can <hi>open the Eyes of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Eph.</hi> 1. 17. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And beſides our Heavenly Father has promiſed <hi>to give the Spirit unto them that ask him, with much more willingneſs than Earthly Parents will give bread to their own Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That Conſcience may be well informed, <hi>We muſt walk with the wiſe;</hi> that's the way to be wiſe our ſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>He that walketh with the Wiſe ſhall be Wiſe, but a Companion of Fools ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> There is a deſtructive infection in Sin &amp; error, therefore thoſe cautions of our Lord. <hi>Take heed what you Hear,</hi> and <hi>Take heed whom you Hear.</hi> And the Apoſtle tells us that the Words of falſe Teachers <hi>will Eat like a canker,</hi> or like a Gangreen. Gangreens ſpread ſtrangely, and the gangren'd member is cut of for the preſervation of the Body. On the other ſide there is a kind of ſanative or healing contagion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Wiſdome; by converſing with Saints, and Spiritual guides, that are humble, and holy, and well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the things of God, by degrees we ſhall come to have our ſenſes better exerciſed <hi>to diſcern both Good and Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let this be your deſign in deſiring that Conſcience may be informed well; <hi>that you may do well, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that information.</hi> When Chriſt asked the blind man that had had ſight miraculouſly given to him, <hi>Doſt thou Believe on the Son of God?</hi> he anſwers, <hi>Who is he Lord that I might Believe on him? Joh.</hi> 9. 35, 36. He askes who he was, as being very ready to Believe on him. So ſhould we inquire, Lord what is thy will, that we may do it? what are thy Commands that we may yeild obedience to them? What is the reaſon why the Lord will teach the humble? 'tis becauſe theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, that they may Do what is required, they have ſubmitted themſelves unto God, and he ſees that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44406:54"/> if they are entruſted with the Talent of Knowledge, they will Trade with it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Beware exceedingly of falſe Lights.</hi> If a falſe Light get into the Conſcience, what ſad work will it make there? When men take a lye to be truth, how zealous are they in a bad matter? Tis a high piece of curſed art in the Devil to winde himſelf into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men; he gets into their wills and into their affections more eaſily. He layes before them his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary baits of pleaſures and profits and preferments. And in all this, he is no other than <hi>the God of this world;</hi> here is no need of any great Metamorphoſis, for he knows that theſe things will eaſily take with the fooliſh and corrupt hearts of ſinners. But that he may get into the Conſcience, he acts more ſubtilly. <hi>He transforms himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> and he transforms his inſtruments too, ſo that they ſeem <hi>to be the Ministers of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14, 15. he puts ſheeps cloathing upon the ravening Wolves, that they may more eaſily prey upon the flock of Chriſt. Surely the cunning of this enemy, eſpecially ſince we are warned, ſhould make us wary.</p>
            <p>But ſince every light doth pretend to be true, how ſhall we know which is falſe? Certainly we muſt try the Spirits by the written Word, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, 'tis becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> The VVord is of Divine Authority, whoever rejects it, has no underſtanding; whoever does wreſt it (that is, does make ſome paſſages of it to ſpeak againſt it ſelf, and the whole deſign of it) he does it to his own deſtruction; nay though an Angel from Heaven, ſhould Preach a Doctrine contrary to it, we muſt ſtiffly oppoſe him, and boldly ſay, <hi>He is accurſed, Gal.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:44406:55"/>
            <p> 2. As the goodneſs of Conſcience lies in its illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and being rightly informed; <hi>So in the due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of its Authority and Power.</hi> The force of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is very great when 'tis exerted; ſo that good men have lookt upon themſelves as <hi>Debtors,</hi> and not to have paid their debts unleſs they have done their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the wiſe and to the unwiſe, ſo as much as in me is, I am ready to Preach the Goſpel to you that be at</hi> Rome <hi>alſo,</hi> they have lookt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as bound in Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 22. <hi>And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I go bound in the Spirit unto</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things that ſhall befall me there:</hi> and being thus bound in Spirit he could not give himſelf a latitude and diſpenſation, though the Holy Ghoſt did witneſſe in every City, that Bonds and Afflictions did abide him. Conſcience has made good men to conclude themſelves under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> to obey, and they have profeſſed they <hi>could not do otherwiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 16. <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I Preach not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> and ſo Act. 4. 20. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have Seen and Heard.</hi> Now what that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Authority is which a good Conſcience exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, I ſhall ſhew you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſcience has Authority and Power <hi>to controul the commands of the higheſt Potentates on Earth, if they agree not with the Law of God. Darius</hi> makes a Law, that <hi>none ſhould ask any Petition of any God or Man for thirty dayes together, but only of himſelf who was the King, Dan.</hi> 6. 7. 9. But <hi>Daniels</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence told him, that that Law which did reſtrain pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the God of Heaven, was impious: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the penalty was being caſt into the Lyons Den, <hi>He went to his Houſe, and he opened his Window,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:44406:55"/> to ſhew he was not afraid or aſhamed, either of his God, or of his ſervice, <hi>and he kneeled upon his knees, and three times a day, prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did afore-time, v.</hi> 10. VVhen the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh rulers laid injunctions upon the Apoſtles, which were contrary to what Chriſt had enjoyned, they ſpeak thus; <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God that we ſhould obey you rather than God, judge ye, Act.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt add, that when the Commands of Magiſtrates are broken, becauſe againſt Conſcience; we had need to look to it, that Conſcience have ſufficient warrant from the VVord of God. For though we ſuffer never ſo peaceably and patiently, the penalty which humane Laws inflict; 'tis no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Government, that the Lawes are ſuch, as good men and Conſciencious cannot comply with: and of this reputation, ſo far as poſſibly we may, we ought to be very tender. Certainly we are to obey <hi>Magiſtrates, and to be ready unto every goodwork,</hi> and onely when they command evil are we exempted from obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſcience</hi> has authority and power <hi>to croſs our ſecular; intereſt though the gain, if unlawful, which is offered, be never ſo great.</hi> In all debates concerning profit, God allows <hi>Conſcience</hi> a Negative voice. Thoſe pleas for unlawful courſes which are urged from the advantageouſneſs of them, Conſcience ſayes are naught; and that it is a mad venture, to hazzard the ſalvation of the ſoul, for a little of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs. When <hi>Achitophel</hi> gave counſel to <hi>Abſalom</hi> which was likely to deſtroy <hi>David. Abſalom</hi> ſayes <hi>let us hear what</hi> Huſhai <hi>the Archite alſo adviſe</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Huſhai</hi> anſwers, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The counſel of</hi> Achitophel <hi>is not good.</hi> So when the carnal minde does
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44406:56"/> counſel not to ſtand upon ſtrict points of honeſty, where gain is to be gotten; Conſcience will deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſay, this counſel is not good: <note n="(z)" place="margin">
                  <l>

               <hi>for they that will thus be rich, do fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts which drown men in deſtruction and perdition.</hi> The corrupt mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which is deſtitute of the truth, does ſuppoſe that gain is Godlineſs; but the good Conſcience thwarts it, and ſayes, <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſcience has authority and power, <hi>to prohibit and forbid the practice of the moſt beloved ſin:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Delilah,</hi> or an <hi>Herodias,</hi> 'twill ſay, <hi>'Tis not lawfull for thee to have her.</hi> As in the natural body, whatever the conſtitution be, there is a mixture of all the four humours, but one uſually is predominant, from whence a man is denominated, Sanguine, or Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, or Cholerick, or Melancholick: So in the body of ſin though there are the ſeeds of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet ſome particular corruption commonly is moſt prevalent. Now conſcience has authority to ſtrike at this that is the favorite. Conſcience told <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> he could not be upright before God unleſs he kept himſelf from <hi>his own iniquity,</hi> and therefore he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. The ſin that naturally is moſt beloved, there is moſt reaſon to hate it, for God is moſt diſhonoured, and the ſoul is moſt defiled, and endangered by it. And if Conſcience may make bold to check Temptations to the moſt beloved ſins, ſurely it may caution againſt any ſin whatſoever, and indeed, it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44406:56"/> does not go beyond its authority when it forbids as much as God himſelf does: for it is Gods under-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to prevent as much as may be all trangreſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſcience has power and authority <hi>to enjoyn the moſt difficult duties.</hi> 'Tis difficult to ponder the path of our feet, and in all places, and relations, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and employments, to walk circumſpectly; 'tis difficult to ſet a watch before the door of our lips, that ſinful and idle words come not out, which will but tend to make our account ſad at the day of judgement: 'tis difficult eſpecially to keep our hearts with all dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that God may have them, and the world and ſin may not run away with them. How much pains will it coſt us, to conflict with wicked and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent thoughts: to obſerve the firſt ſtirrings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and to quench theſe ſparks preſently before they be blown up into a flame; to engage in a conſtant combate with the fleſh, which is continually luſting againſt the Spirit! But though all this be difficult, and the fleſh cryes out, <hi>Theſe are hard ſayings,</hi> yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience urges to it, and puts us in minde, that the word is the more to be loved <hi>becauſe 'tis very pure,</hi> Pſal. 119. 140. and, that the more we keep from ſin, the greater is our freedom, perfection, peace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſcience has Power and Authority <hi>to preſſe unto the greateſt hardſhips and ſufferings for Chriſts ſake.</hi> The Goſpel is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>the VVord of the Croſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 18. not onely becauſe it Preaches Chriſt Crucified, but alſo a conformity to him as crucified. And as our Lord was Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was glorified, ſo we muſt be willing to take up the Croſs, that we may come to the Kingdom, to follow him in his Temptations, that we may follow after him
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44406:57"/> to the Throne. Conſcience tells us that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be offended in Chriſt, for he never calls us to part with any thing but what is vain, nor to endure any thing but what he will ſanctifie and ſweeten to us, and we are not to think much of afflictions, that <hi>are but light,</hi> that are <hi>but for a Moment,</hi> that work <hi>for us,</hi> and that work for us <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.</p>
            <p>And when tempted in the time of perſecution to fall away, Conſcience alſo layes before us, the wrath of God, which is ten thouſand times more dreadful than the wrath of perſecutors, and 'twill be but a poor relief to be delivered out of their hands, and to <hi>fall into the hands of the Living God.</hi> VVhen <hi>Spira</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience had renounced the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in VVord had publickly owned the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh corruptions: Alas what did he get by it? the torments of his Conſcience were worſe than any Inquiſition; and the deſpair he was overwhelmed with, made his condition worſe than if he had endured the very uttermoſt of Papal cruelty. Some of his words were theſe: <hi>What a dangerous thing is it to diſſemble upon any terms in thoſe matters where the Glory of God is concerned! what a fearful thing is it to be</hi> neer <hi>and</hi> almoſt <hi>a Chriſtian! Oh that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I would ſcorn the threats of the moſt cruel Tyrants, bear torments with invincible reſolution, and Glory in the outward profeſſion of Chriſt, till I were choaked in the flame, and my Body conſumed to aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus great is the Power and Authority of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a good Conſcience does Exerciſe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but becauſe the Conſciences of moſt ſeem to have loſt all Power, therefore I ſhall direct you how this Power of Conſcience may be put forth with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44406:57"/> VVould you be under the Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience? then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meditate upon this, <hi>how Holy and equal the Law is.</hi> Since we are reaſonable Creatures 'tis fit we be govern'd by ſome Law or other, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Omnium quae in hominum Doctorum diſputatione verſantur nihil est profecto praestabilius, quam plane intelligi nos ad juſtitiam eſſe natos, neque opinione ſed naturâ Jus conſtitutum eſſe.</hi> Cicero, <hi>de leg</hi> 1. p. 221.</note> and what Laws are comparable to the Law of God? man ſtands in need of a Law that may put bounds to his Will and Affections, as well as regulate his Converſation; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws onely reach the latter, but the Law of God principally requires Holineſs in the former. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves are not without a Law: the Apoſtate ones tranſgreſſed it, and were caſt down to Hell: <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Angels are affirmed to do <hi>the Commandements of God, and to hearken to the Voice of his Word, Pſal.</hi> 103. 20. And truly all the Commands of the Lord are Holy juſt and good, the more we obey theſe, the greater is our Liberty and freedom from the Power and Tyranny of Sin and Satan unto whom whoſoever are ſubject, they are defiled, degraded, debaſed, and made miſerable by that ſubjection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider not only the equalneſſe of the Law, but <hi>the greatneſs and goodneſs of the Lawgiver.</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells you of a Lord, who has right to rule you. He has given you your Being, and upholds you in your Being you could not <hi>live or move or be without</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:44406:58"/> 
               <hi>him.</hi> And therefore by all right imaginable, he is your owner and your Governour. <hi>We are Debtors</hi> ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>not to the fleſh to live after the fleſh, for if we live after the fleſh we ſhall dye, Rom.</hi> 8. 12, 13. he does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay we are Debtors to God, this was ſo evident there was no need to expreſs it. The Lord is ſo great that he may claim obedience from us, for we owe him whatever we have and are: and his goodneſs does ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly match his greatneſs. He is <hi>Optimus &amp; Maximus,</hi> there is abundant reaſon then, why you ſhould liſten unto Conſcience preſſing you to give him the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence before <hi>all other Lords</hi> whatſoever. No King comparable to the King of Saints, how ready is he to defend them; how much does he conſult his ſubjects welfare.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Would you be under the Authority and Power of Conſcience? fix this upon your Spirits, <hi>that a good Conſcience alwayes uſes its Power for your good.</hi> I may here apply thoſe words which the Apoſtles uſes concerning Magiſtrates, <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of this Power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame,</hi> for Conſcience is the Miniſter of God to thee for good. Name a ſin which a rightly informed Conſcience does bid thee abſtain from, which is not really a miſchievous and hurtful, as well as a moral evil; and thou haſt leave to keep it. Name a duty which ſuch a Conſcience urges, which is not for thy profit, and thou ſhalt never be blamed for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it. What the Lord wiſhes Conſcience ſpeaks over again. Oh that there were an Heart in you, that you would fear your God, and keep all his Commandments alwayes, that it might <hi>be well with you</hi> forever! <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. Conſcience aimes at this perpetually, that it may be well with you and well
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44406:58"/> for ever with you; nay, even then when it puts you upon the ſuffering of penal evils it does deſign your good: they that are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake receive <hi>an hundred fold in this Life,</hi> they have ſo much of grace, and of the Preſence of God, as is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold better than any thing that's taken from them, then in the World to come they are aſſured <hi>of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Think ſeriouſly <hi>of the deſtructiveneſs of thoſe courſes which Conſcience would hinder you from taking.</hi> Thou art not able to hurt the Lord by thy iniquity; the Clouds are higher than thou, but He is infinitely higher than the Clouds. <hi>If thou ſinneſt what doeſt thou againſt him?</hi> ſays <hi>Elihu; or if thy tranſgreſſions are multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what doeſt thou unto him?</hi> Job 35. 5, 6. His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs is ſo great, and out of the reach of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that by ſin thou art not able to diſturb it, though failing in Duty towards him thou art juſtly puniſhed: So that thou hurteſt not him, but thy ſelf by ſin. <hi>Do they provoke me to anger, ſaith the Lord? Do they not provoke themſelves to the Confuſion of their own Faces?</hi> Death is at the end of the broad way, ſays Conſcience, and therefore go no longer, no further in that way, but turn thy Feet into the way of Peace; If thou goeſt on ſtill in thy treſpaſſes, thy Feet really go down to Death, and thy ſteps will moſt certainly at length take hold on Hell.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Would you be under the Power and Authority of Conſcience? <hi>Beg that the Lord himſelf would ſtand by, and aſſiſt this his own Officer;</hi> and then its Authority will be Exerciſed to purpoſe: Then <hi>ſtrong holds and Imaginations will be caſt down, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowlege of</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:44406:59"/> 
               <hi>God, and every thought will be brought into Captivity unto the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. When the under-Officer is oppoſed, an higher Magiſtrate comes with a greater force to help him in the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his Duty. If the King himſelf with a great Military power ſhould be ready to aſſiſt a Conſtable, ſuppoſing he were reſiſted, none would then dare to withſtand. When the God of Heaven does Second and ſtrengthen Conſcience, then all within a Man bows before it, and yields unto it. As 'tis the preſence of God and his gracious concourſe that does bring Faith and Love, and other Holy habits of the Soul into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful exerciſe, ſo 'tis this which does make Conſcience vigorouſly to do its Office. That's the Second thing implied in a good Conſcience: <hi>The due Exerciſe of its Authority and Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The goodneſs of Conſcience <hi>lies in its being wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and attentive.</hi> What Phyſitians ſay concerning Melancholy, that it has a tendency either to ſtupifaction or to diſtraction, may truly be affirmed concerning ſin; that it has a tendency either to ſtupifie the Conſcience, &amp; caſt it into a deep ſleep; or to terrifie the Conſcience, and to make it even diſtracted with the ſenſe of the Lords Anger. There is a ſtrong inclination to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy in every Natural Mans Conſcience, and this Diſeaſe does grow more and more upon him. But in a good Conſcience this Diſeaſe is in a good meaſure healed, and great care is taken leſt there be a relapſe into this ſleepy ſickneſs. How often are we called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Scripture to Watch, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. <hi>ult. What I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch.</hi> Chriſt had before urged this Duty of Watching, upon his Diſciples: Here he repeats it, and extends it unto all. But watch
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44406:59"/> we cannot, unleſs our Eyes are open, unleſs our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are awake. Now, this wakefulneſs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiveneſs of Conſcience diſcovers it ſelf in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The attentive Conſcience <hi>eyes the Rule.</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>In Sacris Scripturis inveniuntur illa omnià quae continent fidem moreſque vivendi.</hi> Aug. de doc. Chriſt. l. 2. c. 9.</note> What was ſaid of <hi>Apollos,</hi> may be affirmed of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that 'tis mighty in the Scriptures. What is the meaning of that injunction laid upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael, That they ſhould bind the words and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, for a ſign upon their hands, and that they ſhould be as frontlets between their eyes, and that they ſhould write them upon the Poſts of their Houſes, and upon their Gates?</hi> Deut. 6. 8. 9. The meaning is this, that their Conſciences ſhould always remember, and have a regard unto the Word of God: when they ſat in their Houſes, when they walked by the way, when they did lye down, and when they roſe up. <hi>Be ye not unwiſe,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>but underſtanding what the Will of the Lord is,</hi> Eph. 5. 17. Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not what is for our Carnal Intereſt, what is for our Credit and Reputation among the generality of Men, what is for our eaſe, and the way to ſleep in a whole skin: but it's inquiſitive, what it is that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and agreeing to his Will, and nothing that is ſo, can really be to our prejudice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The attentive Conſcience <hi>Obſerves the Perſon in whom it is;</hi> that he may not ſwerve from, but ſquare both Heart and Life according to that Rule which is given to him. A good Conſcience has a very good Eye, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44406:60"/> a very quick ſight; it has an inſpection upon the whole Man. It Obſerves what comes in at the Doors of the External Senſes, and whether there be a Covenant made with the Eye, and the Ear be deaf to Vanity, and eſpecially to all manner of ſollicitations to evil. It ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves how the Members are Employed, that Sin and Satan may not abuſe them, and turn them into <hi>Weapons of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> for then our own Members will be Weapons to deſtroy us. Nay, it Obſerves our very Hearts. Thoſe <hi>motus primò primi,</hi> thoſe very firſt ſtirrings of Corruption in the Heart will not be long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſpied by a watchful Conſcience. It looks with a very jealous eye upon our hearts, becauſe they are ſo trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and their Natural deceitfulneſs is but in part Cured: And its care is, that nothing may ſteal away our Affections from that God who does infinitely beſt deſerve them; and that we may not be biaſſed by any baſe, carnal, low ends in any of our Actions, but that God may be <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The attentive Conſcience <hi>takes notice of the wiles and devices of the evil One.</hi> It very well remembers how <hi>the Serpent beguiled our firſt Parents through its ſubtilty;</hi> and therefore keeps a ſtrict Guard againſt that Adverſary. It furniſhes us with the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, whereby we may repell Satan in his Aſſaults. Does he tempt to Pride? Conſcience ſays It's Written, <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble:</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. Does he tempt to Covetouſneſs? Conſcience ſays, 'tis writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry, and for this things ſake the wrath of God cometh upon the Children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> Col. 3. 5, 6. Does he tempt to injuſtice? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſays, 'tis written, <hi>Let no Man go beyond, or</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:44406:60"/> 
               <hi>defraud his Brother in any matter, becauſe the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 6. Does he tempt to Uncleanneſs? Conſcience ſays, 'tis written, <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers God will Judge;</hi> and <hi>no Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger nor unclean Perſon hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> Eph. 5. 5. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Conſcience meets Satan at every turn, and is a very great Defence againſt him, for it directs us to God, in whom our ſtrength lies, and to the Armour of God, <hi>which being put on, we ſhall ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil,</hi> Eph. 6. 11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The attentive Conſcience <hi>heeds the Spirit of the Lord in his Holy Motions and Suggeſtions.</hi> There are two ways whereby the Spirit of God may be known, <hi>He glorifies Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>he leads to Holineſs: He glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies Chriſt,</hi> John. 16. 14. <hi>He,</hi> that is the Spirit of Truth, <hi>ſhall glorifie me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>for he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> Thoſe that talk of the Spirit, and trample Chriſt under foot, and count his Blood a common thing, certainly are guided by a falſe Spirit: the Holy Ghoſt always glorifies Chriſt, Teaches that he is the onely Redeemer and Mediator, by whom we have acceſs to God, and that we could never have had admiſſion into the Holieſt of all, but by his Blood; and whatever Benefits we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they are the Fruit of his purchaſe. And as the Spirit Glorifies Chriſt, ſo he <hi>leads to Holineſs,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. When the Spirit accompanies Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or Providences, and we find in our ſelves more than Ordinary ſtrivings to purge us from what does pollute us, and ſtrong endeavours uſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us unto a thorow-Sanctification. Conſcience takes Notice of the Spirits Operation, and bids us to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44406:61"/> yield to him, and by no means to thwart and grieve him.</p>
            <p>If now you demand, how Conſcience may be made thus attentive? I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Deafen your Ears againſt perſwaſions to evil. Adam</hi> hearkned to Satan, we have been the more apt to hearken to him ere ſince, and not to regard our own Conſciences. If you heed not Conſcience, Conſcience may at length not heed you; if your Ears are open to the Tempter, and deaf to Conſcience, Conſcience may at length be dumb to you, and ſuffer you to go your own way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Cumber not your ſelves about many things.</hi>

I confeſs we do ſo, and are not aſhamed of it; to Pray, is to call in the help of the great Phyſitian, without whom all means that are uſed muſt needs be ineffectual for our Cure. Every good gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights; and therefore Conſcience can be made to ſee, and to be attentive by no other. Thus of that Third particular, <hi>The goodneſs of Conſcience lies in its being Watchful end attentive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The goodneſs of Conſcience <hi>lies in its tenderneſs.</hi> A great deal of tenderneſs there is in the World: how tender are many in points of Honour! They cannot put up any thing that looks like an Affront, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſatisfaction: their hearts riſe againſt any that ſtand in their Light, or leſſen their Repute; nay, ſome are ſo tender of their Fame, that they will venture even Life it ſelf to ſecure it. How tender are others of their Eſtates, they will part with their Eyes almoſt as ſoon as part with their Wealth: Their Gold is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and their God. Others are tender of their Relations, Wives, Children; how careful are they that no harm befall them, and eſpecially of their own Fleſh they are tender; the Body can lack nothing, but many ſollicitous thoughts are ſpent about it, for its ſupply, and if it be in any danger, for its ſecurity. But all this while where ſhall we find any tenderneſs of Conſcience? Some do look upon this as an Argument of a mean Spirit, others fancy this tenderneſs to be be needleſs, and that it onely betrays want of wit, and will be prejudicial to our Intereſt. But certainly ſince God is ſo tender of his Honour and Authority, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44406:62"/> ſince he will ſo ſeverely puniſh them that break his Commandments: Conſcience cannot be over tender in this matter; we are truly the more wiſe, the more tender we are. Some do think, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>Righteous,</hi> is derived from <hi>Right-wiſe.</hi> I am ſure the Righteous Man is the right wiſe Man: he whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſtupid, is in the worſt ſence fool-hardy.</p>
            <p>The tender Conſcience has theſe enſuing Properties whereby its tenderneſs may be known.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The tender Conſcience <hi>is afraid of Secret ſins as well as Open; of heart-ſins, as well as thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Converſation.</hi> Open ſins are worſe than Secret in this regard, becauſe of ſcandal; but in ſecret ſins there is a more fixed reſolution many times againſt Reformation. When ſin retires to the Heart, and is not ſo much taken Notice of by any breaking forth in the Practice, its ſtrength may be greateſt, juſt as an Oven, unto which Wicked Mens hearts are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 7. is then hotteſt when 'tis ſtop'd cloſeſt. Sin may Reign moſt abſolutely in the Heart, which is its Throne when 'tis not at all diſcerned by the Eye of others. Thus 'tis ſaid of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, that none were more abſolute Monarchs, and yet they were very ſeldom ſeen by the People. <note n="(d)" place="margin">

O the Fooliſh contempt of God, when his Eye is deſpiſed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44406:62"/> and onely Mans is feared. God hates ſin ten thouſand times more than Man can hate it, and can likwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ten thouſand times a greater puniſhment. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, the Lord requires the Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart:</hi> a tender Conſcience dares not allow ſin ſo much as a Lodging there, though it ſeem content never to ſhew its Face abroad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A tender Conſcience <hi>is afraid of little ſins as well as great.</hi> As Camels are not ſwallowed, ſo Gnats are ſtrained at: <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quicquid nunc parvi pendendo tranſimus, palpando tegimus, diſſimulando negligimus, quanto illic cruciatu vindex flamma con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumet? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam magis nunc daret quis capiti meo aquos, &amp; ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis meis fontem lachrimarum, fortè enim non reperi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Deo.</hi> p. <hi>mihi</hi> 408.</note> Little ſins are great enough, if unrepented of, to undo the ſinner; there is no ſin ſo little, but there is a need of the Blood of Jeſus to make an attonement for it. When we ſpeak of the degrees of ſin, we ſhould think of the degrees of torment in Hell: though ſome places in Hell are hotter than others, yet none are cool; thoſe that are leaſt of all tormented, ſhall be tormented for ever, and ſhall have no cauſe to brag of eaſe. So, though ſome ſins are more evil and hainous than others, yet there are none but what are very bad, and if made light of, will prove heavy enough to ſink the Soul into condemnation. A tender Conſcience is perſwaded of all this, and does not cry concerning any ſin, Is it not a little one? A little Leak in a Ship is feared and ſtop'd; a little fire in an undue place is feared, and quenched; a little ſin by a tender Conſcience is not allowed, but mortified. Little ſins are not without their peculiar Aggravation, for we ſtand
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44406:63"/> with God in a ſmall matter; this Argues great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs and neglect of him. And hence that ſaying holds true. <hi>Quò levius mandatum eò gravius peccatum.</hi> The eaſier the Command, the more is the tranſgreſſion aggravated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A tender Conſcience <hi>is afraid of the Occaſions of Evil;</hi> it knows very well how vehement the bent of corrupted Nature is; and upon this ſcore 'tis unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we ſhould come where there is forbidden Fruit, leſt, that Fruit be luſted after, and then eaten. He that ventures upon Occaſions of ſin, 'tis a ſign that there is a ſecret hankering after it, and then no wonder if he fall into it; or at leaſt, that he has high thoughts of his own ſtrength to withſtand any Temptation; and ſuch ſelf-confidence is ordinarily puniſhed by Divine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings, and then to be ſure Temptation will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. <hi>Peter</hi> cryed out, <hi>though all men ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended:</hi> and afterwards, <hi>though I ſhould dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee,</hi> Mat. 26. 33. 35. He unadviſedly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Chriſt to the High-Prieſts Palace, and being there, his ſinful fear diſcovers it ſelf, he denies his Maſter, to ſecure himſelf; he denies him thrice, and that with a Curſe and Oath that he never knew him, <hi>verſe</hi> 74. See what became of all his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. A tender Conſcience is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſelf-diffidence, and cauſes us upon this ſcore to keep far off from what is evil. <hi>God putteth no truſt in his Servants, yea, his Angels he chargeth with folly;</hi> ſurely then we have Reaſon to diſtruſt our ſelves. <hi>Enter not into the way of the Wicked,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, go not in the path of Evil Men, avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away,</hi> Prov. 4. 14, 15. All Occaſions of ſin are heedfully to be avoided. Tender Conſcienced <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as he hearkned not to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44406:63"/> ſo he cared not <hi>to be with her,</hi> Gen. 39. 10. He thought it was not good to come too neer that fire, (ſo a naughty Woman is ſet forth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 27.) for fear at laſt he might catch ſome heat.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A tender Conſcience <hi>if it ſuſpect any thing to be ſin it will forbear, till ſatisfied.</hi> 'Tis better a great deal not to go to the utmoſt bounds of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then to go beyond it: better an indifferent thing ſhould be abſtained from as unlawful, than that which is really unlawful ſhould be ventured upon as if it were indifferent. The Iſraleites when newly planted in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> were ſo tender that when they did but ſuſpect, that the <hi>Reubenites,</hi> and <hi>Gadites,</hi> and half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> had built an alter for Burnt-Offerings, they they preſently come out againſt them: for as there is but one Mediator, ſo there was to be but one Altar for Burnt-Offerings, namely, That which was made by Gods own appointment, <hi>Joſh</hi> 22. This unſatisfiedneſs concerning ſome things, which yet we cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily pronounce to be ſinful, is I grant an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infirmity and weakneſs in the Conſcience; but truly 'tis <hi>bonum ſignum ex malâ cauſâ</hi> a good ſign from a bad cauſe, it argues a true fear of ſin; when not only all known ſin, but that which is ſuſpected to be ſo, is eſchewed.</p>
            <p>A tender Conſcience is not bold and venturous, 'tis afraid of Errours in Judgement, as well as wickedneſs in practiſe. As Malice and VVickedneſs is compared unto leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. ſo likewiſe errour and falſe Doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 12. <hi>Then underſtood they how that he bad them beware, not of the leaven of Bread but of the Doctrine of the Phariſees and Sadduces.</hi> Since Errour is like unto Leaven; is of an inſinuating and ſpreading Nature, and Chriſt himſelf ſayes <hi>Beware;</hi> no wonder if a tender Conſcience be cautious, and flies
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44406:64"/> from thoſe who publiſh divers and ſtrange Doctrines. 'Twas a notable ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quae eſt enim peior mors animae quam libertas erroris? omnes pacem quam omnis doctus &amp; indoctus intelligit praeponen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam eſſe diſcordiae, diligamus &amp; teneamus unitatem. Hoc jubent Imperatores quod jubet &amp; Christus quia cum bonum jubent, per illos non jubet niſi Chriſtus.</hi> Aug. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 166 ad Donat.</note> 
               <hi>That the liberty of Errour is the Souls death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. A tender <hi>Conſcience takes notice of Gods anger while it hangs in the threatnings, and before that anger break forth, urges unto deep humilation.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs heart was tender and he did humble himſelf before God,</hi> when he heard his words denounced againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the inhabitants thereof, and did rend his Clothes and wept before the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27. A tender <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not ſatisfied unleſs contrition be true, ſuch as God calls by that Name; and ſuch as he has promiſed <hi>reviving</hi> to, <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 57. 15. 'tis not ſatisfied unleſs the Heart be rent as well as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be broken off from ſin, as well as broken for it. Oh how will a tender <hi>Conſcience</hi> bring ſins to Remembrance! twill lay on load and not ſpare, to this end that Chriſt may be prized who alone can give reſt. <hi>David</hi> cryes out <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, my Iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up, they are more then the hairs of my Head, therefore my Heart faileth me,</hi> Pſal. 40. 12. and then he adds ver. 13. <hi>Be pleaſed O Lord to deliver me, O Lord make haſt to help me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. A tender <hi>Conſcience</hi> is <hi>afraid of caſting any of Gods Commands behind the back, but preſſes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:44406:64"/> 
               <hi>unto all the Lords precepts. David</hi> was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender when he ſaid, <hi>I eſteem all thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning all things to be right, Oh that my ways were directed that I might keep thy Statues! then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, Pſal.</hi> 119. 5, 6. 128. 'Tis ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, that they were both Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs, Luke</hi> 1. 5, 6. A tender <hi>Conſcience</hi> bids us eye ſuch copies as theſe; and write after them. No Ordinance of Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but God is ready to own it, and to be found in it, if he be ſought in a due order; and therefore no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is to be neglected. To live in the omiſſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duty which God has Commanded, is to cut off a golden pipe whereby Grace may be conveyed to us; and herein we do not conſult our own good.</p>
            <p>You ſee how the tenderneſs of <hi>Conſcience</hi> diſcovers it ſelf. But the great queſtion will be, <hi>How may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be made thus tender?</hi> ſurely a queſtion need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be reſolved. For tender <hi>Conſciences</hi> where are they to be found? ſtupidneſs of Soul is an Epedimicall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady 'tis the diſeaſe of the Age, and the nearer the world approaches to its end, the more is this Diſeaſe likely to prevail. For ſuch a ſecurity will go before the burning of the World at the laſt day, as went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the drowning of it in the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi> The profane among us have ſo much loſt, that they laugh at tenderneſs of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Multitudes of profeſſors, their <hi>Conſciences</hi> can ſwallow almoſt any thing: they can live in pleaſures, and care about the World more then about the better part, they can fulfil their fleſhly luſts, and yet <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſo wretchedly blind and dumb that at preſent it does not diſquiet them. Nay the

               <hi>Wiſe Virgins themſelves ſlumber.</hi> Believers many of them have loſt their firſt tenderneſs; and therefore more then we are aware of are concerned in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>How may a Conſcience be made tender?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Study better the Nature of Sin.</hi> I will boldly ſay that a ſtupid <hi>Conſcience</hi> knows not what ſin is; if once 'twere underſtood; it could not poſſibly be made light of. All that are hardned in ſin, are deceived by it. Therefore the Apoſtle gives that caution, Heb. 3. 13. <hi>Exhort one another daily while it is called to day leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> As God is an incomprehenſible good, ſo ſin is an incomprehenſible evil. <note n="(g)" place="margin">

               </note> No Creature can fully underſtand it: onely God, who knows how good him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is, knows how evil ſin is; which is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and contrary to him. But though we cannot ſound the bottom of this evil, no more then we can dig to the Earths Centre: yet much is diſcovered by the VVord of God. Sin is worſe then the Devil, for it made him a Devil. Take ſin from the Devil, he will be a glorious Angel: if ſin get into a glorious Angel 'twil turn him into a Devil preſently. Sin will make us like the Devil if we go on in it, and bring us into the ſame ſtate of unalterable miſery.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:44406:65"/>
            <p> But let us view ſin a little with relation to God. 'Tis a daring of his Power and Preſence, a bold chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging of the Almighty to do his worſt. 'Tis an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of his Majeſty; a caſting off of his Authority; <hi>Let us break his bands aſunder, and caſt away his cords from us,</hi> Pſal. 2. 3. 'Tis a robbing him of his Glory, which is ſo dear to him, and which he is ſo unwilling to give to another. 'Tis a ſlighting of his Goodneſs, which is ſo vaſt and large that it ſhould attract the Love and Hearts of all; and which alone can ſatisfie and be beatifical to the Soul of Man. 'Tis an injury to his Juſtice, contrary to his Holineſs, denies his Truth, makes him a Liar, for neither Promiſes nor Threatnings are believed. Nay, Sin ſtrikes at the very Being of God: for if hating our Brother be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of him, Ah! what is hatred of God to be called? No wonder that the Lord is ſo angry at ſin, and turns thoſe that will by no means turn from it, into Hell; and makes them for ever to bewail their Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. If Sin were but rightly underſtood, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would be tender of offending; we ſhould not dare to be ſo venturous upon ſo great an evil. Would you grieve for ſin? cry out, <hi>What have I done?</hi> would you be tender and afraid to ſin, when tempted; ſay, <hi>What am I about to do?</hi> how much ſhall I do againſt God? how much ſhall I wrong my own Soul?</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Conſcience may be tender, <hi>ſee him that is inviſible. Moſes</hi> did thus by the eye of Faith, and this made him ſo tender, <hi>that he refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Pharoahs <hi>Daughter: he eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and choſe rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin which are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11. 24.—27. The thoughts of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44406:66"/> God, do diſturb the ſtupid Conſcience; therefore wicked men care not to ſpeak, or hear, or think of him. But Believers endeavour to imitate <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me;</hi> and this makes and keeps Conſcience very tender. Look up often to God, and the frequent viewing of him will encreaſe both Fear and Love. <hi>David</hi> having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died well the Omni-preſence of God, and perceived that in every place God was perpetually by him; he deſires to have his heart and thoughts ſearched, and tried, and every wicked way in him diſcovered; and Conſcience is ſo tender, that he dares and cares to go in no way but the way that is everlaſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>See God in every ordinance; then Conſcience will tell you he is jealous about his worſhip, that he is <hi>a Great King;</hi> and hath ſaid, <hi>Curſed be the deceiver, who having a male in his flock, voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> Mal. 1. 14. See God in every providence; then Conſcience will tell you, that mercies are not to be abuſed, nor conſumed upon your luſts; and that afflictions are ſent to take away your Sin. See God in every Temptation; how eaſily then will Conſcience ſilence the Tempter, by telling him, 'tis not ſafe to provoke the Lord to his very face, 'tis not wiſdom to forfeit his Favour, to incurr his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for ſuch poor things as Satan offers; his greateſt offers are but poor; and oh how far does the Lord outbid him!</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Conſcience may be tender, <hi>Bewail the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidneſs of it, and cry to have it cured.</hi> Follow God with reſtleſs importunity; <hi>Lord enlighten my eyes and awaken my Conſcience, lest I ſleep the ſleep of death.</hi> He will be angry with you if you ſhould think that you can
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44406:66"/> cure your ſelves of this malady; you cannot pleaſe this Phyſician better than to make uſe of him. You have great encouragement to ſeek unto him; for he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>A new Heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the Heart of stone out of your fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. The ſtone in the heart and the ſtupidneſs of the Conſcience are diſeaſes near a kin; nay the one does include the other: a ſtony Heart implies a ſenſeleſs Conſcience, and an Heart of fleſh a Tender-conſcience. Hope in this word of Promiſe; He is faithful that has made it: Never any yet have found the Lord backward to heal, that were indeed weary of their Diſtempers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Conſcience may be tender, <hi>Eye the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Saints whoſe tenderneſs in Scripture is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> How tender was <hi>Joſeph!</hi> though his Miſtreſs tempted him, and he a Servant; though he was a young man, and Single; though opportunity offered it ſelf, and there was a great probability of ſecrecy in reference to his Maſter; though he was likely to be accuſed of an attempt to Raviſh, if he did not conſent to commit Adultery, and hereby his Maſters rage might endanger his life; Yet Conſcience was ſo tender that he did not dare to do ſo great a wickedneſs. O <hi>Joſeph</hi> though thou hadſt a beautiful outſide, yet thy inſide, thy Heart was much more amiable! How tender was <hi>Job,</hi> there was none like him in the Earth: he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and eſchewed evil: and throughout <hi>chap.</hi> 31. you may read with what care and Conſcience he Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed it. He was ſo watchful againſt uncleanneſs that <hi>he made a Covenant with his eyes;</hi> he was ſo juſt, that he did not <hi>deſpiſe the cauſe of his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> He was ſo Merciful, that he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44406:67"/> like a <hi>Father to the Poor,</hi> and <hi>like a guide</hi> and Husband <hi>to the Widdow.</hi> He was ſo free from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, that <hi>he rejoyced not at the deſtruction of him that hated him, neither did he lift up himſelf when evil found him.</hi>

               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:44406:69"/> 
               <hi>in Witneſs-bearing.</hi> As we are not to bear falſe Witneſs concerning our Neighbour, ſo neither ought Conſcience to bear falſe witneſs concerning our ſelves. Conſcience muſt not be like <hi>Fame; Tàm ficti pravi<expan>

God, whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer Conſcience is, is a God of Truth, and the Word, which is given for its Direction, is the Word of Truth; and if that Conſcience Flatter us, it will but injure us; if it deal Faithfully, though it ſpeak never ſo terribly, it may do us a great kindneſs. You muſt know that a good Conſcience may <hi>Accuſe</hi> as well as <hi>Excuſe.</hi> It Accuſes indeed of evil, but 'tis not evil that it does Accuſe, <note n="(i)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Neque magis vitio verti potuit conſcientiae poſtea, cùm juste accuſavit &amp; condemnavit, quàm ipſi legi &amp; Judici ſummo qui idem fecit poſt ingreſſum peccati; non ante.

            <p n="1">1. The Accuſations of a good Conſcience are juſt, ſin is the ground of thoſe Accuſations; and the better the Conſcience is, the more immediately there will be a ſmiting of the heart, after the prevailing of a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thus <hi>David</hi>'s heart <hi>quickly ſmote him after he had numbred the People, and he ſaid, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done, and now I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the Iniquity of thy Servant, for I have done very Fooliſhly,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 10. And when a good Conſcience Accuſes, 'tis not eaſily ſatisfied; 'twill not be quiet till there be a confeſſion of ſin before
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44406:69"/> God, a loathing of it, and pardon and healing are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through our Lord Jeſus. While <hi>David kept ſilence,</hi> that is, refuſed ingenuouſly to confeſs his fault, his Conſcience was clamorous, <hi>and his Bones waxed old through his roaring all the day long; and his moiſture was turned into the drought of Summer,</hi> Pſal. 32. 3, 4. but at length he has Peace, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and my Iniquity have I not hid, I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the Iniquity of my ſin,</hi> Selah.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as the Accuſations of a good Conſcience are juſt, ſo it will <hi>Excuſe, if there be good Reaſon for it.</hi> It will call Grace, Grace, if it be true, though it be but weak. God does not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, neither ought Conſcience. It ought not by taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice onely of ſin, and over-looking the Spirits work in the Soul, to go about to break the bruiſed Reed, and quench the ſmoaking Flax. It muſt be granted that Believers Conſciences do bring in a falſe Teſtimony againſt them at ſome ſeaſons; and they make bold to call themſelves Hypocrites, and to affirm that there is nothing in them but what may be found in Reprobates. But this is no part of Conſciences goodneſs, and they are to be reproved; becauſe upon every light ground they are ſo apt to queſtion their Eſtate, and to rank themſelves among the Hypocrites; in doing thus they gratifie Satan exceedingly, and hinder their own Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, becauſe they are ever queſtioning whether the Foundation be rightly laid; and God has little or no thanks from them, though in giving them the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſaving Grace, he has done more for them, than if he had put Scepters into their hands, and Crowns of pure Gold upon their Heads.</p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:44406:70"/>
            <p> But you will ask, how may Conſcience be made thus Faithful in its Teſtimony? I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If you would have Conſcience bear witneſs truly, <hi>neither add unto, nor diminiſh from the Word of God.</hi> Call not thoſe, Sins, which are not tranſgreſſions of his Laws; and call not thoſe, Duties, which he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. God has ſo fully revealed his mind in his Word, that whatever is not expreſly contained in it, or by firm conſequence deducible from it, Conſcience is not to take notice of, either as Truth or Duty. Look not into falſe Glaſſes, which Satan will be apt to ſet before you. The Scripture is the true Glaſs, and 'tis the thankful Glaſs too, which mends the eyes of them that look into it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Look well into your ſelves;</hi> be willing to take notice of the evil in you as well as the good (and which is needful to be added for the ſake of humbled Souls) be willing to Obſerve that good which God has wrought in you, as well as the evil which you labour under.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it be your earneſt requeſt at the Throne of Grace, <hi>that your own Hearts may not deceive you.</hi> As Satan is a lying Spirit, ſo your own Spirits are falſe to you, and are ready to joyn with him. God is able to diſcover you unto your ſelves; though the Heart be ſo deceitful above all things, that the Prophet crys out, who can know it? <hi>Yet the Lord ſearcheth the Heart, and tryeth the Reins,</hi> Jer. 17. 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Be willing that Conſcience ſhould ſpeak truth, whether that truth make for you or againſt you:</hi> That was a bad temper of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who hated <hi>Micajah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he Propheſied not good concerning him, but evil,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:44406:70"/> 1 Kings 22. 8. and becauſe he could not endure to hear of Evil, at length he feels it, and there was no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: When Conſcience does ſpeak moſt againſt you, in ſome Reſpects, 'tis for you; becauſe whatever you aile, there is a Remedy provided in the Goſpel. To know the truth of your Condition if it be bad, does not make it worſe, but is one good ſtep unto the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it for the better. That's the Fifth thing, <hi>A good Conſcience is Faithful in Witneſs-bearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The goodneſs of Conſcience <hi>lies in the purity of it.</hi> Nothing in the Soul of Man can be ſaid to be good, in a Scripture-ſence, unleſs purged; for as the whole Soul is Corrupted by Nature, ſo renovation in the whole is needful; our Underſtandings are not good till Sanctified; <hi>to depart from evil is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> our Affections are not good, till cleanſed; our Conſciences are not good, till purged. I do not, I dare not affirm, that this purity of Conſcience in this Life is ſo compleat, as to exclude all manner of defilement: in this ſence, <hi>who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Prov. 20. 9. But that which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel accounts purity of Conſcience, lies in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where the Conſcience is pure, <hi>no ſin is conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or covered.</hi> If we cover ſin, God will not cover it; we ſhall not be of the Number of thoſe Bleſſed ones, whoſe Tranſgreſſions are forgiven, whoſe Iniquities are covered and to whom the Lord will not impute ſin. A pure Conſcience therefore, without any guile or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, confeſſes all before God; and as it confeſſes all it knows, ſo 'tis willing to know more, that more may be acknowledged and bewailed. <hi>Job,</hi> among
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44406:71"/> other Arguments, uſes this, and 'twas a ſtrong one, to prove the purity of his Conſcience; <hi>that he had not covered his Tranſgreſſion as</hi> Adam, <hi>by hiding his Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Boſom,</hi> Job 31. 33. He that conceals a Thief, ſides with him; and he that hides ſin, 'tis a ſign his heart is not turned from it. A pure Conſcience is free and open, does not mince or extenuate, but aggravate Iniquity: It can appeal to God concerning its unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to conceal any of his Enemies (for Mens Luſts are Gods Enemies, and their own too) and it can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Satan to Name a ſin which 'tis not ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Conſcience is pure, <hi>every ſin is hated.</hi> Hatred is never better placed than upon ſin. Our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not to be hated; nay, we are forbid to hate our Enemy: but ſin we may hate without ſparing. <hi>David</hi> tells us, that <hi>through Gods Precepts he got <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore he hated every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. By the Word his Conſcience was Informed and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and this Univerſal Hatred of ſin followed. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is an Affection which aims at Deſtruction, and when 'tis high 'tis againſt the whole kind. Thus <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> hated <hi>Mordecai, and thought it ſcorn to lay hands on</hi> Mordecai <hi>alone, but ſought to deſtroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole Kingdom of</hi> Ahaſuerus, <hi>even the People of</hi> Mordecai, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 3. 6. The pure Conſcience ſtrikes at the whole kind of ſin: <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſt intentio Odii, nocere; nec ceſſat in laeſione peccati, ſed in exterminio: verè poenitens juratus est in mortem peccatorum.</hi> Guil. Pariſienſi. <hi>De Rhetor. divin. c.</hi> 23.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis, whether in the Mind, in the Will, in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44406:71"/> in Word, in the Actions. What <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks concerning Idolatry, it does apply unto all ſin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>Thou ſhalt utterly deteſt it, and thou ſhalt utterly abhor it, for it is a curſed thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Conſcience is pure, <hi>The whole Image of God is deſired,</hi> and that the Soul may be like unto him in all things, wherein 'tis its Duty to reſemble him. What the Moral Philoſophers ſay concerning the Mortal Vertues, that they are <hi>inter ſe concatenatae,</hi> that they are linked together, holds certainly true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe Graces which are wrought by the Spirit of God; they are ſo linked together, that you cannot have one in truth but you muſt have all in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This is a ſweet Truth to a pure Conſcience, for all Grace is longed after. Therefore Chriſt's fulneſs is eyed, and prized, and application is made to him, <hi>that out of that fulneſs we may receive, and Grace for Grace,</hi> John 1. 16. That is, that we may receive Graces anſwerable to thoſe Graces which Chriſt has received of his Father for us: Thus the Wax does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Character for Character from the Seal, and the Child Member for Member from the Father, though not of the ſame bigneſs and proportion. The pure Conſcience is not double minded, 'tis not partly for God, and partly for <hi>Mammon;</hi> partly for Chriſt, and partly for Satan. But this is the deſire that the God of all Grace, would work every Grace in Truth, and make all Grace more and more to abound.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Conſcience is pure, <hi>the Myſtery of Faith is held faſt:</hi> The Apoſtle joyns Faith and a good Conſcience together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Holding Faith and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, have made ſhip-wrack.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44406:72"/> 9. <hi>Holding the Myſtery of the Faith in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Whoever are truly purified, do prize the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and the Myſteries of it; they admire the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Mans Redemption by Chriſt Jeſus, and are perſwaded ſince his Blood is the <hi>Blood of God,</hi> that 'tis ſufficient to purchaſe loſt Souls, and to purchaſe the loſt Inheritance. The Myſtery of Regeneration they are acquainted with, and the abſolute Neceſſity of it. And though Juſtification by the Imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt be Argued againſt, as abſurd, by delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Papiſts, and their wretched followers; though the work of the Spirit in renewing &amp; changing of the Heart, be derided by Profane Wits; nay, by ſome that would be accounted Maſters in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> A pure Conſcience notwithſtanding retains theſe Myſteries. Thus the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> though <hi>they dwelt where Satans Seat was, yet they held faſt Chriſts Name, and did not deny his Faith, and that even in thoſe days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Faithful Martyr</hi> Antipas <hi>was ſlain among them,</hi> Rev. 2. 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where Conſcience is pure, <hi>God is Served in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and there is a willingneſs to live honeſtly.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that he <hi>Served God from his Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with a pure Conſcience,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 3. he did not Preach a new God, but the ſame which <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Prophets were the Servants of. This God he Served with a perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind; his Conſcience did bear him witneſs, that his very Soul was engaged in the Lords Work; and that he was very well pleaſed both with his Maſter, and with that buſineſs which his Maſter had Employed him in: and they were not his own things, but the things of his Lord which were ſought by him. And as a pure Conſcience engages to the Service of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44406:72"/> God, ſo to the living honeſtly, Heb. 13. 18. <hi>We truſt we have a good Conſcience in all things, willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</hi> Where ſuch a Conſcience is, that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is heeded, Rom. 13. 12, 13. <hi>The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand,</hi> that is; the preſent time (which is compared to the night becauſe moſt are aſleep in it, and much wickedneſs lies hid and is not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed) the preſent time is far ſpent; is almoſt come to an end; and the day is at Hand, that is, the day of Judgement when all ſecrets will be brought to Light; <hi>Let us therefore caſt off the works of Darkneſs and let us put on the Armour of Light, let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, not in Chambering and Wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and Envying, and make no Proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfil the Luſts thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. VVhere Conſcience is pure, <hi>a greater meaſure of Holineſs is aſpired unto, and endeavoured after.</hi> Though ſin does remain in a ſanctified Heart, yet does it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main quietly, Conſcience deals hardly with it, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did with <hi>Hagar, Abrahams Egyptian</hi> Concubine, and is not ſatisfied, till 'tis turned out of doors: though Grace is incompleat, yet compleatneſs is deſired, the promiſes of Sanctification are lookt upon as very great and precious, and they are pleaded; that the Divine Nature, may more and more be partaken of by them, &amp; the Corruption that is in the world through luſt more fully eſcaped. A pure Conſcience will not ſuffer us to reſt in that Grace which is already attained, but cauſes us to preſſe towards the mark: and <hi>to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of the Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
            <p>But now it is to be inquired, How Conſcience may be made thus pure? unto which I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:44406:73"/> 1. <hi>The Word of God is like a fire to purifie, Jer.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Is not my Word like Fire ſaith the Lord? and like an Hammer that breaketh the Rock in pieces?</hi> the word is compared to an Hammer, becauſe as the hammer does break the Rock, ſo does the Word the the Heart, though never ſo hard and ſenſeleſs; 'tis compared alſo to fire; becauſe like fire, it does both give light, and refine, and purifie the Conſcience. <hi>Yeare Clean</hi> ſayes Chriſt, but how? <hi>through the word that I have ſpoken unto you, John</hi> 15, 3. Let the Word of Chriſt therefore dwell in you richly, 'twill be an Excellent and effectual Antidote againſt ſin and temptation: when your Hearts ſtand in awe of the Word of God, as <hi>David</hi>'s did, how will it preſerve you from defilement!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Affliction is like a Furnace to refine,</hi> That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be pure, Affliction is to be improved. The Rod of Affliction, though it ſeem to be dry and withered, yet like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, 'twill bud and bloſſom, and bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs afterwards it yieldeth the Peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs unto them that are Exerciſed thereby:</hi> And before the Apoſtle informs us, that 'tis God's deſign in Afflicting, to refine and purifie, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>We have had Fathers of our Fleſh, who Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, and we gave them Reverence, ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and live?

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Blood of Chriſt purges the Conſcience from dead works.</hi> This is the Fountain which in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is ſet open for S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So, Heb. 9. 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Offered up himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the Living God.</hi> Though our Lord aimed at our Juſtification, and the Remiſſion of ſin, when he ſhed his Blood, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed himſelf for us, yet he had our ſanctification
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44406:74"/> and cleanſing alſo in his eye. Upon this Account the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That he bear our ſins in his own Body on the Tree; that we being dead unto ſins, might live unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. And we read, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. that <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might Sanctifie and cleanſe it, and preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be Holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Apply this Blood unto your ſelves, be perſwaded that it has a ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue; and pray for purity, as that which is a great part of Chriſt's purchaſe, as well as your own Perfection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you would have Conſcience pure, <hi>you must not reſiſt, but yield unto the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis his Work, not onely to ſhew ſin, but to ſlay it: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of ſin, and alſo Mortifies the deeds of the Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye; but if ye through the Spirit do Mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> The Power of ſin is great, and this Power is ſtrengthned by the Principalities and Powers of Darkneſs, who do endeavour to keep up ſins Dominion: So that if the Spirit of the Lord did not ſhew the exceeding greatneſs of his Power, our Hearts and Conſciences would ſtill remain defiled; we ſhould never have our Fruit unto Holineſs, nor the end everlaſting Life. I have done with that ſixth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>The goodneſs of Conſcience lies in the purity of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The goodneſs of Conſcience lies <hi>in the calmneſs and peace of it.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44406:75"/> the wiſdom which is from above, That 'tis firſt pure, and then peaceable, may be applied unto a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: firſt, 'tis pure, then peacable; there may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be purity without peace; but there cannot be true peace without purity. There is a falſe peace which is too commonly found in the ungodly and the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; this peace ſin does not diſturb, but increaſe: and by this peace the ſtrong man armed does keep poſſeſſion. But true peace is peculiar unto them that are ſanctified; and when once they have attained unto it, they are brought as it were within the Suburbs of Heaven, and ſee the dawning of that Light which is everlaſting. That you may the better diſcern this true peace of Conſcience I ſhall ſet it forth in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. True peace of Conſcience <hi>is founded upon the Blood of God.</hi> So Chriſts Blood is called, for as <hi>he was made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh;</hi> ſo he is expreſly affirmed to be <hi>over all God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. There could be no remiſſion of ſin without ſhedding of blood, and no other blood would ſerve the turn: the blood of Bulls and goats would not take away ſin, Heb. 10. 4. Nay ſuppoſing that Mans blood had been ſhed for us, it would not have been expiatory. <hi>Shall I give my firſt born for my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion? the fruit of my body for the ſin of my Soul?</hi> Mic. 6. 7. Nothing but what ſatisfies the juſtice of God, will ſatisfie and pacifie the Conſcience; and bring it to a well-grounded tranquillity: but 'tis the blood of Chriſt alone that ſatisfies divine juſtice; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience therefore can have no true reſt till that blood be applied. <hi>Luthers</hi> Conſcience could never be quieted with Popiſh pennance and ſeverities, but when he came to underſtand that great Article of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44406:75"/> Faith in the Blood of Jeſus. <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                  <hi>In corde meo iste unus regnat articulus, ſcilicet.</hi> Fides Chriſti, <hi>ex quo, per quem, &amp; in quem omnes meae diu noctuque fluunt refluuntque theolicae cogitationes.</hi> Luther, <hi>in Epiſt. ad Gal. praefat.</hi>
               </note> Oh then the ſtorm was laid; by applying this blood of Chriſt, he was able to joy in God through the Lord Jeſus by whom he had received the atonement. Where the Blood of Chriſt is not known and truſted, there cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be true peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True peace of Conſcience <hi>ſuppoſes reconciliation with God.</hi> As long as there is no peace above with God, there can be no true peace within. Where this is, the covenant of peace has been taken hold of, and the terms of reconciliation have been ſubmitted to. The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>God is in Chriſt reconcileing the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them:</hi> Nay, though himſelf be the party injured by ſin, though he be unſought to, though he has no need at all of the ſinner, and be ſo infinitely high above him; yet he ſtoops ſo low <hi>as to beſeech him to be reconciled,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. and he does aſſure tranſgreſſors though never ſo great, that if they rely upon Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and are broken for ſin, and conſent to turn from all their wicked wayes and thoughts; he will multiply forgiveneſs, and will have mercy upon them. Now when theſe terms are conſented to, and Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are wrought in the heart, God is now no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a Foe, but a Father. All this is ſuppoſed in peace of Conſcience: 'tis conſequent upon peace with God, and cannot go before it. We muſt <hi>be</hi> the Sons of God, before we can <hi>know we are ſo,</hi> and rejoyce in our Adoption.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:44406:76"/> 3. True peace of Conſcience, <hi>is alwayes joyned with Righteouſneſs:</hi> juſt as the ſtars of the ſame Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion part not, but riſe and ſet and keep together. The Holy Ghoſt has joyned Righteouſneſs and Peace: Rom. 14. 17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace, and joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> Righteouſneſs is put firſt to ſhew that all Peace and Joy is falſe without it. There muſt be the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed; and there muſt be Holineſs and Righteouſneſs imparted where true peace is. The fruits of Righteouſneſs are called <hi>peaceable</hi> in Scripture, becauſe <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſo well ſatisfied in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon them. If any known wickedneſs be practiſed in the life, or ſo much as loved and regarded in the heart; as it will be a barr to communion with God, ſo 'twill be an effectual impediment unto peace of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Iſa. 57. 20, 21. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. There is no peace ſaith my God unto the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. True peace of <hi>Conſcience, is not without a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ground to warrant it.</hi> Upon this account it is called the fruit of the Lips, Iſa. 57. 19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace;</hi> becauſe 'tis built upon that word which the Lord has ſpoken. The good <hi>Conſcience</hi> does argue from Scripture-premiſes, and drawes both a ſweet and a ſafe concluſion. There are indeed a great many paralogiſms or falſe wayes of arguing; as when we argue our ſtate to be good becauſe Members of the viſible Church, and Profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; becauſe we engage in ordinances and have a name that we live. But a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> uſes other <hi>Mediums.</hi> It obſerves what are the Characters of Believers, which are not to be found in any Hypocrite
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44406:76"/> in the world; and finding theſe in the Heart, it does juſtly conclude a man to be a right Believer. From <hi>our prizing Chriſt above all,</hi> it argues we have <hi>Faith in him.</hi> From <hi>our loving of God, and deſiring after him,</hi> it argues that <hi>we were firſt loved of him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7. 1 Joh. 4. 19. From <hi>our Repentance and Hatred of Sin,</hi> it argues <hi>that Iniquity ſhall not be our Ruine.</hi> From our <hi>being Spiritually Hungry,</hi> it argues we ſhall <hi>be filed with good things.</hi> From <hi>our Hearts being in Heaven,</hi> it argues <hi>our Treaſure is there;</hi> and that there is a place preparing for us. Such things as theſe are ſound evidences of a good ſtate; and that peace that is thus warranted, is highly Rational: and though the Rain deſcend, and the Floods come, and the VVinds blow, and beat never ſo vehemently, they will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſturb it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. True peace of Conſcience is <hi>ſpoken by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God:</hi> therefore it is called the <hi>peace of God.</hi> Phil 4. 7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall keep your hearts and mindes through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> God is ſaid to ſpeak peace to his people, and he does it by his Spirit, Pſal. 85. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace to his People and to his Saints: but let them not turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to folly.</hi>

If the Holy Ghoſt did not help the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when 'tis looking into us and prying after Grace, and the Evidences of the new Creature; we ſhould never be able to diſcover any thing. Satan and our own hearts together would ſo confound us, that our doubts would be invincible: and we muſt needs be ſtrangers to peace. Saints in Scripture have begged of the Lord to examine and to prove them; and not without reaſon: 'tis from him we have <hi>eye-ſalve to diſcern our condition,</hi> that we may not on the one hand ſay we are rich and increaſed with Goods, when we are Empty and Miſerable: nor on the other hand, ſay we are Empty, when we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. True peace of Conſcience <hi>is ever accompanied with a Spiritual combat, in which the Spirit does luſt againſt the Fleſh;</hi> to be at peace with the Fleſh and the Luſts of it, is in effect to make a Covenant with death and to be at agreement with Hell. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tells us that in all true Believers, the Fleſh is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by its contrary the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe two are contrary the one to the other.</hi> By Spirit here we are to underſtand the ſpiritual and regenerate part in the Saints. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> There is not only a combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Conſcience and the Fleſh in ſincere Believers; but there is a Combat in their very Hearts and Wills: <hi>Luſting</hi> or Deſiring is an act of the Will; now becauſe 'tis ſaid the Spirit Luſteth againſt the Fleſh, 'tis a ſign the Heart is weary of it. The Will would fain have the Fleſh and the Affections of it crucified. Peace of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44406:77"/> Conſcience cannot be where ſin is liked and cheriſhed. When Satan does object againſt a Believer the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of corruption, Conſcience has this to plead and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that theſe reliques of the old man are a very Body of Death which Believers ſigh and groan to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it may be asked, how may this true peace of Conſcience he attained? I ſhall ſay ſomething at preſent, though afterward I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Would you have peace of Conſcience; be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled more deeply, and grieve more heartily becauſe of ſin.</hi> The Apoſtle does not only ſay <hi>be afflicted,</hi> but <hi>mourn,</hi> but <hi>weep, let your laughter be turned to mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and your joy to heavineſſe, Jam.</hi> 4. 9. He uſes ſeveral words importing the ſame thing, to ſhew that 'tis not a ſlight ſorrow which ſin calls for, nor a little humiliation which will uſher in peace. Our Lord calls <hi>the mourners bleſſed, for they ſhall be Comforted:</hi> and the Prophet tells us <hi>that the high and lofty one that inhabits Eternity, will dwell with them that are of an humble Spirit,</hi> and to this end, that they may be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; <hi>to revive the Spirit of the humble and to revive the Heart of the Contrite Ones.</hi> Oh reflect upon your ſelves, call to remembrance how much evil, and how little good has been done by you all your days: thoſe evils which have been done how have they been aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; &amp; that good that has been done, how has it been leſſened by your manner of doing it! look ſo long on ſin till you find your Hearts break and melt, till you are utterly diſpleaſed with your ſelves. This is the way to have a kind look and a good Word from God. When
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44406:78"/> 
               <hi>Ephraim repented, did ſmite upon his Thigh,</hi> to ſhew that ſin was matter both of his ſorrow and indignation, <hi>when he was aſhamed and confounded</hi> in himſelf; What does the the Lord ſay? <hi>Is Ephraim My dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my Bowels are troubled for him and I will ſurely have Mercy on him ſaith the Lord, Jer.</hi> 31. 19. 20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you would have true Peace of Conſcience <hi>acquaint your ſelves better with the Goſpel.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is called the <hi>Goſpel of Peace, the Word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</hi> Chriſt is called the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and the Father, <hi>The God of Love and Peace;</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſtiled the Ambaſſadors of Peace, that Preach glad tidings of good things. Though upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> there be nothing but blackneſs, and Darkneſs, and Tempeſt, though the Law does bind the ſinner under the Curſe, and cauſe the Heart to quake and tremble; yet upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> we may behold <hi>Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and that Blood of ſprinking which ſpeaketh better things than that of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. In the Goſpel Chriſt is ſet forth as a propitiation, and through him God is ready to forgive, and Plenteous in Mercy and Redemption. Here's good news indeed to ſee all things thus prepared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an union and agreement; and all that is required of tranſgreſſors is, that they ſhould expect peace no other way but by Chriſt Jeſus, and that they ſhould conſent to rebell no more. Now when the Conſcience obſerves, that Chriſt is alone relyed on for reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and nothing elſe is truſted in; and that the Heart is grieved at its Rebellions, and now is willing to yield it ſelf to God; Peace hereupon follows.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:44406:78"/> 3. Be not <hi>ſtrangers unto that duty of ſelf-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> The reaſon why ſinners are not troubled is, becauſe they do not know themſelves, nor the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that Eſtate in which they are: and the reaſon why Saints have not Peace, is becauſe they are not ſo well acquainted with themſelves as they ſhould be, they do not ſo well underſtand what an happy change the Lord has wrought both relative and real; both in their condition, and in their Heart and Spirits. What delving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and digging, and turning up the bowels of the Earth to find out Silver and Gold! And ſurely 'tis worth our while to ranſack and ſearch our ſelves throughly, if that we may find what is much more precious then Gold that periſhes. The Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is expreſs: <hi>Examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves,</hi> and the end wherefore they were thus to examine and prove, was, that they might know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether they were in the Faith, whether Chriſt were in them yea or no, 2 Cor. 13. 5. And while you are thus upon trial of your ſelves, ſince a miſtake may undo you for ever; cry, that the Lord who knowes you, would teach you to know your ſelves; and that you may think of your ſelves as he does.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Plead <hi>the Promiſes of ſtrengthning Grace.</hi> For the more ſtrong you are in Grace the more evident the Truth of it will be. The Lord has promiſed <hi>you ſhall grow up as Calves of the ſtall,</hi> and that you ſhall thrive <hi>as Willowes by the water-courſes.</hi> The <hi>Righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palm-tree, and grow like a Caedar in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon; thoſe that are Planted in the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, Pſal.</hi> 92. 12, 13. and all this to ſhew <hi>that the Lord is upright, and there is no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs in him, v.</hi> 15. So that theſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44406:79"/> Promiſes may with confidence be pleaded, and God will not be backward to fulfil them. The more Grace you have, the more 'twill be exerciſed, and the more 'tis exerciſed, the more plainly you will be able to diſcern it, and conſequently have the greater Peace and Comfort in it. Thoſe that have little Grace, and are full of doubts, ſhould ſtrive after ſo much Grace as to be paſt doubt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Love the Commands of God and do them.</hi> If once your Hearts are pleaſed with the Laws of God, 'tis a ſign that you are indeed in Covenant, and <hi>that the Lord has put his Laws in your minds, and writen them in your Hearts, and has been Merciful to your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Hearken to the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Great Peace have they that Love thy Law, Pſal,</hi> 119. 165. Love of the Law will make us carefull to keep it; and this is the way to have the <hi>Lord manifeſt himſelf to us, as he does not manifeſt himſelf to the World, Joh</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandements and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that Loveth me ſhall be lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my Father, and I will Love him and will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my ſelf to him,</hi> and v. 23. <hi>If a man Love me he will keep my Word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him.</hi> The manner of the Father and Sons making their abode in us, we are not ſo well able to apprehend; but the effects of this in-dwelling are more evident, and Peace is one of thoſe effects. Abound in Obedience and the work of God, for that's the trueſt Peace where there are moſt of Fruits of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 48. 18. <hi>Oh that thou hadſt harkened to my Commandements! then had thy Peace been as a River and thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as the Waves of the Sea.</hi>

               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:44406:79"/> 6. Be ſure that <hi>you connive not at any known ſin.</hi> For this will be ſure to hinder Peace, I am afraid that in moſt doubting (I dare not ſay in all) and complaining Souls, that there are ſome luſts or other that they deal gently with, and theſe <hi>Abſaloms</hi> do diſturb their Peace. They indulge to their paſſions, inordinate Affections, Pride, Senſuality, Covetouſneſs; and 'tis no marvel that they are ſtrangers to peace. 'Tis not more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for Water to extinguiſh Fire, than for allowed ſin to hinder peace of Conſcience. It exceedingly grieves the Spirit of the Lord, from whom peace flows, and he will ſuſpend his influences, and will neither quicken nor comfort if himſelf be quenched and grieved. Had <hi>Sampſon</hi> peace in the lap of <hi>Delilah?</hi> or <hi>Herod</hi> peace in the embraces of <hi>Herodias?</hi> ſuch things may pleaſe the fleſh, but they wound the Spirit, and are a trouble to the Conſcience. <hi>If you ſet up idols in your hearts, and the ſtumbling block of your iniquity before your face, God will anſwer you accordingly,</hi> and no peace will he ſpeak <hi>till you repent, and turn from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations,</hi> Ezek. 14. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Begg earneſtly to be <hi>ſealed by the ſpirit unto the day of Redemption.</hi> The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that <hi>after they Believed, they were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of Promiſe, which is the earneſt of our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Chap. 1. 13, 14. This ſealing of the Spirit as it does imply Sanctification, and ſetting us apart for God from profane uſes, ſo alſo an intimation that we are Sanctified, in Order to our being fitted for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and undefiled Inheritance. As 'tis the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which does convince the World of ſin, ſo 'tis he who does convince the Saints that they have Grace and Righteouſneſs.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44406:80"/> 
               <hi>may come and abide in you for ever;</hi> for though you have the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> really upon you <hi>of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and Election;</hi> though you have the <hi>Seals of the Covenant</hi> adminiſtred; nay, though you are <hi>Sealed with the Image of God</hi> in effectual Calling and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; yet till this Sealing Spirit does make it Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, you will not have Peace.

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The goodneſs of Conſcience lies in this, <hi>That 'tis void of Offence.</hi> The Apoſtle does profeſs, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did <hi>Exerciſe himſelf, to have a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God, and alſo towards Man,</hi> Acts 24. 16. A good Conſcience has Reſpect unto both Tables of the Law: Godlineſs and Honeſty are both Commanded; that is, a regard to God, and to our Neighbour. <note n="(n)" place="margin">

               </note> A good Conſcience takes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what the Lord chiefly calls for, namely, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, our Faith, our Love, our Delight; and is not ſatisfied with any External Acts of Worſhip, unleſs theſe Internal and more acceptable pieces of Service are given to him. 'Tis careful alſo that our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man be performed, becauſe the Commands which enjoyn this have the ſtamp of Gods Authority upon them; and we cannot ſin againſt our Brother, but we ſin againſt the Lord, in whoſe Image Man is made, and who has Commanded us to Love our Neighbour
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44406:80"/> as our ſelves. A good Conſcience will not ſuffer any to be careleſs of thoſe Duties of Mercy and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards Men; becauſe God is ſo ſtrict, as to thoſe, that he will permit the external Acts of his own Service to be omitted, rather than Mercy ſhould not be ſhewn. <hi>Go ye and learn that,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice:</hi> That is, <hi>Mercy</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Sacrifice. q. d.</hi> If Sacrifice cannot be Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Mercy muſt be Neglected, let me be without Sacrifice, rather than thy Brother that needs it, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy.</p>
            <p>Two things are here to be Obſerved: A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is void of Offence, in that it will neither <hi>give</hi> Offence, nor <hi>take</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A good Conſcience <hi>is afraid of giving Offence.</hi> What is the Work of Satan? 'Tis to Offend God as much as he is able, and to be putting ſtumbling-blocks before Men, that hereby they may fall into ſin. Now, ſurely Satan is in no wiſe to be imitated. A ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Life, and a good Conſcience cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How expreſs and full is that Command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32? <hi>Give no Offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.</hi> Thoſe that are within, are not to be Offended, leſt they be grieved and diſcouraged: Thoſe that are without, are not to be offended, leſt they be confirmed in their prejudices againſt Religion, and hardned in their wickedneſs: Therefore we are to walk circumſpectly, to Act as upon a Theatre, where many Eyes behold us, and all to this end, <hi>That we may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without Rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation, among whom we are to ſhine as Lights in the World,</hi> Pſal. 2. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:44406:81"/> 2. A good Conſcience <hi>will take no Offence;</hi> that is, not at God, not at Chriſt, not at Religion; whatever it ſees done by Men, or whatever it beholds come to paſs by the Providence of the Lord. A good Conſcience likes not Religion the worſe, though there be never ſo many Hypocrites; for all the Men in the World cannot ſo much inveigh againſt Hypocrites, as Chriſt does ſpeak againſt and threaten them. It likes not Truth the worſe, though never ſo many are led away with the Error of the wicked; though ſo many were turned <hi>Arrians,</hi> yet <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſtood up for the God-head of our Lord Jeſus. A good Conſcience likes not Chriſt the worſe, though never ſo many Apoſtatize; nor Holineſs the worſe, though every where ſpoken againſt; nor Chriſtianity the worſe, becauſe of the Croſs and Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But here two Queſtions are to be reſolved, how ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and how giving offence may be prevented?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Would you take no Offence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Labour after a greater meaſure of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> thoſe that are in the dark, or whoſe Eyes are dim, are more apt to ſtumble, A clearly enlightned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will weigh things well, and will eaſily perceive how unreaſonable 'tis to take offenc at Religion for the miſcarriages of Profeſſors, which Religion does ſo much condemn, and not in the leaſt encourage or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of: How unreaſonable 'tis to take offence at the Goſpel of Chriſt, becauſe of the Croſſe, ſince the Croſſe is ſo needful, is ſo much ſweetned? and the <hi>ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that glory that is to be revealed,</hi> Rom. 8. 18.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:44406:81"/> 2. <hi>Let your Love be ſtronger and ſtronger;</hi> this will lift you up above, and carry you over all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſtumbling blocks. They that Love the Law of the Lord, the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>that nothing ſhall Offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Love towards <hi>Rachel</hi> hindred him from taking offence at any thing; his Wages are changed, he muſt ſerve fourteen years; yet Love made all to be ſwallowed. Love to God and to his Word, will make you content with any thing; you will know how to want, and how to abound; how to go through Honour and Diſhonour, good Report, and evil Report: Love will break through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and make you follow hard after God.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>But, Secondly, <hi>Would you give no Offence?</hi> Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Be encouraged by ſuch Examples, and the ſame Grace which wrought ſuch effects in them, can work the ſame in thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Plead the <hi>Honour of Religion, and Gods own Name</hi> as an Argument to prevail with him to preſerve you from ſcandalous Iniquities. Tell him you deſire to be kept without Rebuke, that his Name may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from Blaſphemy, and that his Doctrine may in all things be Adorned.</p>
            <p>Thus have I at large Diſcourſed concerning the firſt thing which I propoſed. I have told you wherein the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44406:82"/> goodneſs of Conſcience lies, and how it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>In the Second place I am to tell you wherein the Acts of a good Conſcience, and the Acts of the good Spirit of God are to be diſtinguiſhed the one from the other: And before I ſhew the difference between them, I ſhall lay down theſe enſuing Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All that good, whether Light or Grace, or Peace that is in the Conſcience, is wrought by the Spirit of God:</hi> As Gifts are from the Spirit, ſo is Grace moſt certainly from the ſame Spirit, and all that comfort which has any Reaſon or Foundation proceeds from this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter. Whatever means have been effectual to the bettering of the Heart and Conſcience, 'tis from the Spirit they have had their Efficacy. Whatever then we diſcern in our ſelves that is truly good, we muſt eye the Spirit as the Efficient of it, and without his working it would never have been in us at all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Spirit, dividing unto every Man ſeverally as he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When ever Conſcience does its Duty, and Acts as is ought, 'tis certainly Acted by the Spirit.</hi> As the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does inſuſe the Habits of Grace, ſo 'tis he that does produce them into Act and Exerciſe; as he does caſt the Seed of God into the Heart, ſo he makes that Seed to grow, and to bring forth Fruit. <hi>I Laboured,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. If in a Natural ſence we are ſaid to Live in God, and move in him alſo. Surely the Spirit of God is the Author of all ſpiritual Life, and of all ſpiritual and Holy Motions.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:44406:83"/> 3. <hi>Conſcien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e though never ſo good muſt arrogate nothing to it ſelf, but all praiſe is due unto the Lord.</hi> For it is he that makes the difference between the beſt and the worſt Conſcience, and the beſt would be the worſt if he did not make a difference. A good Conſcience is ſaid to <hi>bear witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 9. 1. And as it bears witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, ſo it move to Duty, checks from Sin, encourages upon Welldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all this it does in the Holy Ghoſt, by his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis true that <hi>the Spirit of God does make uſe of Conſcience very much in his dealing with us.</hi> He deals with us as thoſe which have ſuch a power as Conſcience, and that are in a capacity of reviewing our ſelves; and applying what is ſpoken either by way of Terrour or by way of Conſolation; and if the Spirit aid us, we ſhall review and apply to ſome purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Having laid down theſe things, I diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Acts of the Spirit, and the Acts of a good Conſcience, thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God is the <hi>Principal Agent;</hi> the good Conſcience <hi>Acts under him.</hi> As in the work of Converſion the Act of the Miniſter, and the Act of the Spirit are vaſtly different. The Miniſter is a worker together with God, that is, he is honoured ſo far, as to be employed as an inſtrument to good; but what's his Words or Arguments to raiſe the dead in treſpaſſes and ſins? 'tis the Spirit that cauſes Life to enter into the dead dry bones. He that plants is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and he that waters is nothing; ſo truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Spirit did ſecond Conſcience, its acting would be inſignificant, it would be little or not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44406:83"/> at all heeded: nay, it ſelf would become dull and heedleſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirits <hi>motions do differ from the impulſes of Conſcience.</hi> Where the Spirit of the Lord does move more immediately, his motions are with greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and with greater Liberty. The ungodly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not altogether ſtrangers unto the Power of the Spirit. How doth it check them, and reſtrain them; and dam up the ſtream of Corruption for a ſeaſon, as long as 'tis put forth! but chiefly this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is apparent in them that are effectually called. The Spirit impelling them to come to God, does bring them quite home; his impulſe ſhall fetch them out of the fartheſt Country, and bring them to their Fathers houſe. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and where the <hi>Spirit of the Lord is, there is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. The Spirit not only moves us to obey, but alſo enlarges our hearts that we may run the way of the Lords commandments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirits <hi>Convictions differ from the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Conſcience,</hi> as the Cauſe and Effect, as the Antecedent and the Conſequent. The Spirit firſt ſets ſin in order before our eyes, and then <hi>Conſcience</hi> does accuſe and reproach us becauſe of it. And where the Spirit does by a more immediate operation, give a ſight of ſin, and bring it to remembrance; Oh how is the heart affected! What ſelf-abhorrency and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! what Sorrow and Shame! what Knocking of the Breaſt, and Smiting upon the Thigh is there! <hi>Surely</hi> (ſayes Ephraim) <hi>after I was turned I repented, and after I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my Thigh; I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my Youth,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. Now 'twas the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44406:84"/> Spirit that did thus inſtruct and turn him. Thus <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. 27. I will put <hi>my Spirit within you.</hi> And it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ver. 31. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your evil wayes, and your doings that were not good; and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniquities and for your abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirits <hi>witneſs concerning our adoption, differs from the witneſs of our own Spirits,</hi> from the teſtimony of our own Conſciences. The Apoſtle ſpeaks very plainly of a twofold witneſs, that of Our Spirits and that of Gods Spirit, Rom 8. 16. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelf beareth witneſs with out Spirits, that we are the children of God.</hi> This witneſs of the Spirit does not lye onely in his declaring in the Scriptures what kind of Perſons are the children of God; but he alſo helps Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to ſee that they are ſuch kind of perſons; and then enables them to draw the concluſion that they are Children, and Heirs; Heirs of God, and Joint-heirs with Chriſt unto the incorruptible and undefiled inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Now the difference between the witneſſe of the Spirit, and that of Conſcience touching our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in theſe particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirits witneſs is <hi>more clear,</hi> Conſciences <hi>more conjectural.</hi> As we ſee things ten thouſand time more plainly by the Light of the Sun, than by a dim Lamp that burns by us; and yet by that Lamp we may ſee ſomething.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirits witneſs cauſes <hi>greater Boldneſs and Confidence than that of Conſcience.</hi> When the Spirit of Adoption is ſent into the heart, it makes Believers to come with Boldneſs to the Throne of Grace; and to <hi>cry Abba Father,</hi> that is, <hi>Father Father:</hi> the word
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44406:84"/> is doubled to ſhew with what confidence the Spirit makes it to be ſpoken, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. Then they draw nigh with high Hopes, and raiſed Expectations, that their Father will deal bountifully, give liberally, and though they open their mouths never ſo wide, that yet they ſhall be filled with his fulneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirits teſtimony <hi>is more firm, and not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtioned;</hi> that of Conſcience <hi>is more apt to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill'd at by Satan.</hi> If I ſee a thing plainly in the day time, I know I ſee it; and though many ſhould queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether I ſaw or no, yet I make no queſtion: nay though ſome diſtracted perſons that are kept in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and chains, ſhould ſay they ſee when they don't, yet I know I ſee when I do. The Spirits teſtimony does make things thus clear; And the objections of the Accuſer of the Brethren, 'tis evident they are but cavils. Thus ſays the Apoſtle <hi>We have known and believed the love that God hath to us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. But the teſtimony of Conſcience Satan will be more bold to queſtion, and will ſtart an hundred things whereby a weaker Faith may be puzled, and the heart ſtill kept under doubts and fears.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirits teſtimony <hi>produces joy,</hi> that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at beſt <hi>onely a calmneſs and tranquillity.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Apoſtle ſayes the <hi>teſtimony of Conſcience was his rejoycing,</hi> but you muſt know, that he had alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the witneſs and earneſt of the Spirit; ſo that he had more than Conſciences bare teſtimony. The joy that the Spirit creates by his aſſuring Believers of their adoption, is unſpeakable and full of glory. 'Tis ſuch as no Tongue can utter, and no Heart can conceive it but ſuch as have had a taſte and experience of it. 'Tis not meerly a negative thing, or freedom from trouble,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44406:85"/> but poſitive and carries with it ſuch a delight as is not to be found in the higheſt ſenſuality. The Malefactor is at peace when he receives a pardon; but if he be not only pardoned but Preferred, this cauſes joy. The Spirit lets the Soul ſee 'tis pardoned, and preferr'd to be a Child of God, an Heir of Glory, and gives a taſte how Gracious the Lord is, this cauſes not only peace but joy and triumph of Spirit in the God of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>I come now to the third thing I propoſed, to give you the reaſons why it ſhould be every ones great care to have good Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We can have no Communion with God without a good Conſcience.</hi> unleſs our <hi>Hearts are ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience</hi> we cannot draw nigh to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he draw nigh to us: Though we ſay with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great confidence that <hi>we have Fellowſhip with God,</hi> if Conſcience knows <hi>that we walk in darkneſſe,</hi> and we allow our ſelves in the works of darkneſs; the Holy Ghoſt gives us the lye to our face, <hi>and we do not the Truth,</hi> 1 John 1. 6. There cannot be a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on asked of greater importance than this, wherein does mans happineſſe lye? and the trueſt anſwer unto this queſtion is, Mans felicity does lye in Fellowſhip with God. Therefore the happineſſe of the triumphant Saints is ſo full becauſe they are admitted unto ſo near Communion with God. Therefore the Miſery of the damned is ſo great, becauſe they are baniſhed from the Lords preſence, and deſpair of ever coming neer to him, or enjoying of him. And therefore the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of militant Saints is imperfect, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin in them do hinder them from enjoying ſo much of God as otherwiſe they might enjoy. But, where Conſcience is evil there is no enjoying of God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44406:85"/> at all: Where there is no true Holineſs, ſinners are without God in the World, <hi>they ſpend their Mony for that which is not Bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfies not,</hi> Iſa. 55. 2. They only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to broken Ciſterns that can hold no water; but they neglect, and by their iniquities are kept at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Fountain of living Waters. Thus that which is the Hell of Hell they undergo on Earth, and yet ſuch is their ſtupidneſs, they are little, if at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Without a good Conſcience <hi>no ſervice that we perform can be acceptable.</hi> A bad Conſcience is like the dead Flie in the Apothecaries Oyntment, that ſpoils the whole. This was it that made the Lord to ſpeak thus to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, Iſa. 1. 11, 12, 13. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices unto me? I am full of Burnt-Offerings, and the fat of fed Beaſts, and I delight not in the Blood of Bullocks or of Lambs, or of He-Goats. When ye come to appear before me, who hath required at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations, incenſe is an Abomination to me: the Sabbaths and calling of Aſſemblies I cannot away with: it is Iniquity even the ſolemn meeting. When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you: yea, when you make many Prayers I will not Hear.</hi> And the reaſon of all this was, becauſe their Conſciences were defiled with Blood, with injuſtice, with unmercifulneſs, with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Thus alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 3. becauſe their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were defiled <hi>by chuſing their own way and their ſouls delighted in their abominations,</hi> the Lord ſays, <hi>He that kills an Oxe, is as if he ſlew a man; he that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices a Lamb, is as if he cut off a Dogs neck; he that offers an Oblation, as if he offered Swines Blood; he</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:44406:86"/> 
               <hi>that burneth Incenſe as if he bleſſed an Idol.</hi> Two things are abſolutely neceſſary unto the acceptation of our ſervices, one is the <hi>Mediation of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and therefore our ſacrifices, though never ſo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, are ſaid to be <hi>acceptable through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. and the other, the <hi>cleanſing of Conſcience from all known and allowed ſin,</hi> for iniquity <hi>will ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and our God, and make him hide his face from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Without a good Conſcience there can be <hi>no qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et or Peace but will prove exceedingly to our prejudice</hi>

Sin is ſuch a Maſter, as none of its Servants have cauſe to be very jocund. When Death and Hell, (which is the wages of ſin) is paid, then I am ſure 'twill be ſad day with ſinners, and all their jollity will be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the height of anguiſh and tribulation. Art thou without a good Conſcience, and yet art quiet? thy quietneſs is thy Diſeaſe. As there is a Natural Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy whereby Bodies ſleep unto natural Death, ſo there is a Spiritual Lethargy whereby Souls ſleep unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death: and they wake not till the ſight of an angry God upon the Judgment-ſeat, and the feeling of the unquenchable flames of Hell awake them. He had a bad Conſcience that ſaid <hi>Soul take thine eaſe;</hi> and ſo had he, that <hi>fared ſumptuouſly every day,</hi> but their eaſe did them harm, and was a means to bring
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44406:86"/> them unto theſe torments where no eaſe is to be looked for: Ah woe unto ſinners that are at eaſe! <hi>the eaſe of the ſimple does ſlay them, and the proſperity of Fools deſtroyes them, Prov.</hi> 1. 32.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Without a good Conſcience <hi>'tis impoſſible that we ſhould be truly good our ſelves,</hi> If Conſcience be bad, all things elſe within us are likely to be a great deal worſe. If this which ſhould reſtrain from ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at ſin, how will iniquity abound! if this which ſhould be urging unto duty does not it ſelf do its Duty, how will duty be caſt off! there will quickly be a ſaying unto God <hi>depart from us for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes; what is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> Job 21. 14, 15. To ſay that a man has no Conſcience, is as much as to ſay that a man has no goodneſs. When a ſinner is indeed turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God, one of the firſt things that is wrought upon in him is his Conſcience; and the more Holy he is, ſtill his Conſcience does become more Pure, and wakeful, and tender. When a ſinner that is almoſt perſwaded to be a Chriſtian, falls back again, and becomes as vile, nay, viler than ever; his Conſcience rings him many a ſad peal to prevent his relapſe, and 'tis ſometimes a great while before his Conſcience can be charmed. But if once this is laid into a Dead ſleep, the luſts of the Heart will grow impetuous and ſtrong; the affections will be vile, and at length there may be a running out to all exceſſe of Riot in the Converſation. Certainly if Conſcience be bad the whole man is defiled; if Conſcience does exerciſe no Authority for God, ſinners will fulfill the deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind, and will walk according to the courſe of this World, <hi>according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit which worketh in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi>

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:44406:87"/> 5. Without a good Conſcience, as nothing <hi>is good in us,</hi> ſo nothing <hi>is good or pure to us.</hi> The Apoſtlet ells us <hi>that unto the pure all things are pure, but to them whoſe Minds &amp; Conſciences are defiled there is nothing pure, Tit.</hi> 1. 15. A bad Conſcience defiles every thing. A man that is Conſcious to himſelf of loved and regining ſin, whatever Creatures he uſes, he abuſes; his Food, his Eſtate, his Health, his Strength are all impure to him, becauſe his Corruptions are ſerved with all theſe, his bleſſings are turned into Curſes becauſe he makes a ſinful and Curſed uſe of them. Nay not only things ſecular, but alſo things ſacred, even the Ordinances of God, are prophaned and polluted by an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Prayer is turned into an Abomination, and the Lord calls it <hi>Howling, Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their Hearts when they howled upon their beds.</hi> The word becomes a ſavour of Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, the Eyes being ſhut, and the Ears cloſed, and the Heart being more hardened under it.

When the Lord ſpeaks to the Ungodly, his mouth is full of threatnings, his words are woes and curſes, and not one ſyllable of Encouragement or hope does he give them as long as they are reſolved to continue in their wickedneſs. Indeed, if they are willing to have their Conſciences and Converſations cleanſed, then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf inclined to Mercy, and to make them white as Wool or Snow, though before red like Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or like Crimſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. 18.

They are to be Reproved, <hi>whoſe Conſciences are Ignorant.</hi> They are Ignorant of God, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of themſelves, and which is worſe, they care to know neither. Though God be the moſt Excellent Object that can be known, though without Knowing him there can be no enjoying him, though the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God be Transforming, and change us into his Image and Likeneſs; yet how many are willingly Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant! they care not to know him, nor his will, nor what he is able to do, either for them or againſt them. There is a black veil upon their hearts, ſo that they ſee not their Happineſs, nor their Miſery. This makes them unconcernedly, and without fear to turn their backs upon Chriſt and Heaven, and to make great ſpeed after Satan in thoſe ways that lead unto utter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>They are miſerably unacquainted with themſelves, they ſee not in what ſtate they are, they know not whither they are going. <hi>They deſpiſe their own ways,</hi> that is, they take no more Notice of their own doings, than we do of thoſe whom we moſt of all contemn;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44406:90"/> And as for their hearts they are <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> like Land never yet Diſcovered. They may truly ſay that their Hearts were born with them, that the Hearts have been bred up with them, and that they have carried their Hearts up and down with them at their days, and yet they and their Hearts are utterly unacquainted. Oh that theſe dark Conſciences would but conſider theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How much evil there is in Ignorance.</hi> Let Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay, That 'tis the Mother of Devotion, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks otherwiſe, That 'tis the Parent of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. The Prophet having ſaid, there was <hi>no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the Land,</hi> preſently adds, <hi>by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, they break out, and Blood toucheth Blood,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 1, 2. intimating, that Ignorance of God was the cauſe of all the other abominations. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 2, 3. <hi>They be all Adulterers, an Aſſembly of Treacherous Men; they bend their Tongue like their Bow for lies, but they are not valiant for the Truth, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from evil to evil.</hi> Now, from whence is all this? <hi>They know not me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Certainly the Sons of Men are alienated from the Life of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in wickedneſs through the Ignorance that is in them. VVhen Conſcience is Blind, what is there to lay reſtraint upon Corrupted Nature? And if there be no reſtraint, the deſperate Corruption of it will quickly appear, and wickedneſs will be done with greedineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How inexcuſable is this Ignorance, conſidering the Light that ſhines, and the means of Knowledge.</hi> The Advantage of the Jews was great in that <hi>the Oracles of God were committed to them,</hi> Rom. 3. 1, 2. herein
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44406:90"/> they were priviledged above the other Nations, that the Lord had given his VVord unto them. But we have an Advantage above the Jews, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Lords VVill, and of his Glory is much clearer under the New Teſtament than it was under the Old. How fully hath God ſpoken to us in theſe laſt days by his Son! Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel, Death and Deſtruction are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Chriſt Crucified is Preached, who is the Lord of Life and Glory, and a Saviour from Deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Oh, how are they without Apology, who ſhut their Eyes againſt ſo glorious a Light, and will not know thoſe things which are of ſo high concernment to themſelves! Oh, you dark and heedleſs Souls, you may be wept over, as Chriſt did over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you <hi>will not know, in this your day, the things that belong to your Peace,</hi> though quickly, in a way of Judgment, <hi>they may be hid from your eyes,</hi> Luke 19. 41, 42.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Ignorance, as light as you make of it, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</hi> None ever did hit upon the way to Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were aware: The blind will never enter in at the ſtraight Gate, but muſt needs go on in that broad Road that leads to Death and Hell. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 18. <hi>Where there is no Viſion the People periſh.</hi> You read alſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>My People are deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge.</hi> VVhen the Lord does ſave any, he gives them an Heart to know himſelf and his Son Chriſt Jeſus; <hi>but if the Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3.</p>
            <p>I know many Ignorant ſinners look upon their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as their excuſe for their wickedneſs; but how can Ignorance excuſe them, ſince they are glad of their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, are not deſirous to know; nay, hate the

               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:44406:91"/> eternal deſtruction. I would here propoſe theſe three things unto them whoſe Conſciences are of ſo great a latitude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This largeneſs of Conſcience argues great <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and of his Will;</hi> there is not a ſtanding in aw of him and of his word. His word is very ſtrict, his commands holy, and requires that we ſhould walk <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>exactly and circumſpectly,</hi> this is to be wiſe; to do otherwiſe is to diſcover the moſt dangerous folly. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>What manner of perſons,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>ought ye to be, in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs!</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11. But notwithſtanding all this, large conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences live at random, as if preciſeneſs were more ado than needs; and as if the Lord did but jeſt in his Holy Precepts, and thoſe terrible threats which back them; but they to their coſt ſhall find and feel he is in good earneſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This largeneſs of Conſcience is a ſhrewd ſign <hi>that ſinners are in the broad way.</hi> They that can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low camels, 'tis eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for them to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. The Scribes and Phariſees of old, <hi>did omit the weightier matters of the Law, Judgement, Mercy and Faith;</hi> But Chriſt does denounce <hi>a wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> Mat. 23. 23. Largeneſs of Conſcience diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a great careleſsneſs of the ſoul, and too great an indifferency what becomes of it for ever: And what ſouls are likely to miſcarry if ſuch be not? We muſt work out our Salvation with fear and trembling if we will be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:44406:92"/> 3. The larger Conſcience is, and the more is ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at preſent; <hi>the greater hereafter will the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be.</hi> We are all Stewards, which muſt ſhortly give an account of our ſtewardſhip: and though a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> preſent ſome, like the ſteward in the Goſpel, many take their Bills, and write Fourſcore, or Fifty for an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; Yet our Lord who will call us to an Account, will be exact in reckoning, and cannot be deceived by us. <hi>His judgement is according to Truth,</hi> Rom. 2. 2. And oh how many things will he condemn at the laſt day, which ſinners defend at preſent! 'Twill be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a day of Light and Manifeſtation, both of things and perſons. Many perſons that went for Saints, will then be unmasked and found Hypocrites, and have their ſad portion with the Hypocrites; And many things that where counted no ſins, will be found great ſins, and the lighter they were made of, the more heavy and damnable they will prove unto the ſinner. A large Conſcience therefore take heed of. Attend unto the Law and to the Teſtimony, which does diſcover evil; and be afraid of every evil way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are to be reproved <hi>whoſe Conſciences are at peace, but that peace has no ſolid and good foundation.</hi> The moſt of ſinners in the world, have this falſe peace in their own Spirits; ſometimes they are a little awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, but are quickly huſhed aſleep again, by that evil One who does deſtroy ſouls by thouſands, and by milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by carnal ſecurity. Tranſgreſſors when firſt they venture upon ſin, their Conſciences recoyl upon them; but by degrees they grow ſenſeleſſe: Cuſtom in ſin,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44406:92"/> and Quiet in ſin, do go commonly together. <note n="(t)" place="margin">

Ad extremum non potest avelli, quia conſuetudo vertitur in naturam; &amp; quod priùs ad faciendum erat impoſſibile jam impoſſibile est ad continendum.</hi> Bernard, De Conſc. c. 3. pag. 1109.</note> One of the Fathers does excellently deſcribe, how the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly arrive unto this falſe peace. At firſt, ſayes he, ſin does ſeem intolerable, afterwards, onely heavy, after that being frequently given way to, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtunned by many wounds; makes no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them: in proceſs of time, ſin is not burthenſome at all but pleaſant; at laſt 'tis turned into a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the ſinner can no more be drawn from it, than the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> can change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great many not onely Profane, but Profeſſors, are concerned in this reproof; and have no better than a falſe peace of Conſcience. Here therefore I am to ſhew what that peace of Conſcience is, which is falſe; and alſo how unreaſonable it is, to give entertainment to it. A falſe peace of Conſcience I ſhall deſcribe to you in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That peace of Conſcience is falſe <hi>where Sin and Miſery were never ſeen.</hi> They who never perceived any harm in ſin, and wonder why the Lord in his word does ſpeak ſo much againſt it, and why his Miniſters
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44406:93"/> cannot let men quietly alone in the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; who never lookt ſo far as to behold that eternal death and deſtruction that is threatned to be brought upon the workers of iniquity; theſe are at peace becauſe they do not apprehend what reaſon they have to be troubled: there is ſufficient cauſe of grief, and fear, and horrour, onely they want an eye to ſee it, ſo as to be indeed affected. There are ſome that are ſuch fools, as to make a mock of ſin; and count it a paſtime to do wickedly. Theſe do no more underſtand what ſin is, nor the Hell which the Holy God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd upon it, than the mad-man underſtands what he does <hi>when he caſts Fire-brands, and Arrows, and Death, and ſaith am I not in ſport,</hi> Prov. 26. 18. Others though far from being indeed juſtified, think they are righteous; though ſick after a deadly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet imagine they are whole, and undervalue the great Phyſitian. Both theſe ſort of Perſons have peace, but 'tis without ground, for the former do groſly miſtake ſin, and the later do as groſly miſtake themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That peace of Conſcience is falſe, <hi>where the ſtrong man armed keeps poſſeſſion:</hi> where Satan works and rules without reſiſtance. Our Lord ſayes <hi>When the ſtrong man armed keepeth his Palace, his goods are in peace,</hi> Luk. 11. 21. By the ſtrong man we are to underſtand the Devil; by his Palace we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſinners heart; becauſe as a King reigns and commands all, (eſpecially in his Palace) ſo the Devil bears ſway in the hearts of the ungodly. And a falſe peace and quiet, is the great means whereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Rule and Government is upheld. If you are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconcerned whom you are led by, 'tis certain that the Devil leads you; for none are led by the Spirit
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44406:93"/> of God, without great ſollicitouſneſs, and fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſguided; and ſtrong cryes that they may be guided by his counſel unto his Kingdom and Glory. Satan is called <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit which worketh in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> If you make nothing of diſobeying the Word of God, if you walk <hi>according to the courſe of this world, and fulfill the deſires of the fleſh, and the carnal mind,</hi> Eph. 2. 2, 3. 'tis a ſign, that Satan does command you, and your peace is far from being true.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That peace of Conſcience is falſe, <hi>where there is a walking after the imagination of the evil heart.</hi> Thoſe words do ſound like Thunder, Dreadfully rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in the air; Deut. 29. 19, 20. <hi>And it come to paſs when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imagination of mine heart. The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie, ſhall ſmoake againſt that man; and all the Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall lye upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under Heaven.</hi> The heart of man is fooliſh, deceitful, wicked, deſperately wicked; 'tis a very ſore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be given up to our own hearts luſts, and to be ſuffered to walk after our own counſels. Sinners need not other enemies, they are forward enough to go aſtray of their own accord, and to ruine themſelves; let them follow their own hearts, and they will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly come to Hell in the concluſion. If any therefore do walk in the way of their hearts, and pleaſe and gratifie their own ſinfull affections, and ſay they ſhall have peace; they ſpeak without book, without Gods book I am ſure.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:44406:94"/> 4. That peace of Conſcience is falſe, <hi>where the ſoul is intoxicated with ſenſuall Delights and Pleaſures.</hi> Thus the rich man was at peace, whoſe ground brought forth plentifully, who reſolved to pull down his barns and to build greater, that he might beſtow all his Fruits and his Goods: and ſince there were Goods ſufficient for many years; he was clearly for <hi>taking his Eaſe, for Eating and Drinking and making merry,</hi> Luk. 12. 16.—19. One great cauſe of <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, was, their giving themſelves over unto ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity: Whoredom and Gluttony and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do take away the heart; ſuch conſider no more than if they were brutes, nay, they come ſhort of brutes, even the moſt ſtupid of them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſters Crib; but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my People doth not conſider.</hi> Senſual Pleaſures, as alſo Worldly cares, do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the heart, ſo that there is no trouble or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs about eternity; and while they dream not of any ſuch thing, the day of the Lord does come on them like a ſnare. Luk. 21. 34, 35. <hi>And take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs and cares of this Life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares; for as a ſnare ſhall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That peace of Conſcience is falſe <hi>which is built upon preſent diſpenſations of Providence.</hi> Sinners are apt to argue wrong, both from proſperity and from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, that their ſtate is good, and ſo put a cheat upon their own Souls. Some are perſwaded that becauſe the Lord loads them with external bleſſings, this is a certain ſign of his love. But the Holy Ghoſt informs us, <hi>that the ungodly proſper in the World, and increaſe in</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:44406:94"/> 
               <hi>Riches, that they are not in trouble like other men, that they have more than Heart could wiſh,</hi> Pſal. 73. 12. <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, that <hi>even Kingdoms are given to the baſest of men, Dan.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid concerning the <note n="(u)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Turcicum imperium quantum eſt, nihil eſt niſi panis mica quam dives pater familias projicit canibus.</hi> Luther. Tom. 2. in Gen. in cap. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Turkiſh Empire that it was but a morſel caſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dog.</hi> And if whole Kingdoms are given to the ungodly, who can argue himſelf a Saint, and loved of God, from his worldly enjoyments? 'tis not the having of the World, but ſitting looſe from it, looking upon our ſelves as Strangers and Pilgrims in it, and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for God, that will argue we are indeed his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide ſome are perſwaded, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at preſent, that it will be well with them in the Life to come. But wicked men may alſo be afflicted. <hi>God does diſtribute ſorrows to them in his Anger, ſo that they are as ſtubble before the Wind, and as chaffe which the ſtorm carrieth away,</hi> Job 21. 17, 18. 'Tis not then our being corrected that will prove us Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren but our receiving of Correction and being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and reformed by it; though never ſo often in the furnace, if we are not at all Refined we are but Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Silver.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That Peace of Conſcience is falſe <hi>which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on External profeſſion and Priviledges.</hi> Thus of old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny becauſe they <hi>were called Jews, did reſt in the Law &amp; made their boaſt of God,</hi> though at the ſame time they did break the Law, and diſhonoured God by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Tranſgreſſions, Rom. 2. 17. 23. Many
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44406:95"/> now a dayes are called Chriſtians, and beguile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an empty name. It will not advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to name the name of Chriſt, if they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity; to call him Lord, Lord, if they are reſolved ſtill to rebell againſt him. They had great Peace and confidence, who ſaid <hi>Lord, Lord, we have Eat and Drunk in thy preſence, and thou hast taught in our Streets.</hi> And yet both their peace and confidence were without ground, the door is ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they are excluded from the Kingdom; for, they were notwithſtanding all their Profeſſion, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26, 27. By ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion iniquity has the greater aggravation, <hi>(w)</hi> he is moſt inexcuſably ungodly, who has moſt of the form, but nothing of the Power of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That peace of Conſcience is falſe, that is <hi>built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on External Righteouſneſſe, and eſcaping the more groſſe pollutions of the World.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Converſion, <hi>was, touching the Righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs,</hi> Phil. 3. 6. that is, his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo agreeable to the letter of the Law, and ſo free from any foul and ſcandalous ſin, that men could not blame him. But though he was thus <hi>blameleſs,</hi> yet he was <hi>graceleſs;</hi> and though he thought himſelf to be alive, and his ſtate to be good and ſafe, yet he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as he found afterwards.

            <p>There were two great faults in the Righteouſneſs of the Phariſees, and of all thoſe who reſemble them. One is that their Righteouſneſs was only external, ſo their lives were but blameleſſe, they minded not what luſts reigned in their Hearts. The other is, that their Righteouſneſs was truſted, in as that which was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to commend them unto God, whereupon they ſlighted the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt. 'Tis unreaſonable for any to be at peace who go no further than a Phariſee, (if they go quite ſo far;) for our Lord ſpeaks expreſſely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Except your Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. That peace of Conſcience is falſe, <hi>that is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſome lazy wiſhes after Grace and Holineſſe.</hi> There may be in unregenerate Hearts, eſpecially at ſom times, ſome pangs of deſire and inclinations to that which is good, but their deſires to continue bad, are ſtronger and do bear down all their inclinations to good which are much more feeble. <hi>Agrippa</hi> cryed out to <hi>Paul</hi> before a great multitude, and before <hi>Feſtus</hi> who a little before had charged both <hi>Paul,</hi> and conſequently Chriſtianity it ſelf with madneſs. <hi>Almoſt thou perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt me to be a Chriſtian,</hi> Act. 26. 28. Here was an inclinableneſs to Religion, but 'twas born down by a ſtronger propenſion to Worldly greatneſs and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. A Woman may have ſome kind of good will, and Affection for a Perſon, and yet when it comes to the upſhot, refuſe to have him for an Husband; ſo
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44406:96"/> ſinners may have ſome fluttering good thoughts and wiſhes for Chriſt and Grace, and yet utterly refuſe to give themſelves wholly to the Lord Jeſus, or to be indeed and throughout ſanctified.</p>
            <p>Oh how many that ſay they deſire after Grace, and to be rid of ſin, are deceived in and by themſelves! they know not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. Sin in the general they deſire to be freed from, but come to particular ſins which are for their profit, for their credit among carnal men, for their eaſe and pleaſure, theſe they won't let go. Not conſidering who Chriſt is, they are inclined to him; but when they are told, that as he is a Redeemer, ſo a Ruler, and that he muſt bring their very Thoughts and Affections into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience, that they muſt ſubmit to the holieſt Commands, and not be aſhamed or afraid to confeſſe Him, though it coſt them never ſo dear. Here they make a demurr, &amp; then have no real mind to be his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Oh deceive not your ſelves with lazy deſires after Holineſs, where there is a more vehement and fixed deſire to wallow ſtill in your filthyneſs and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That peace of Conſcience is falſe which <hi>is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſome confuſed and general apprehenſions of the mercy of God in Chriſt; but this uſe onely is made of this mercy, encouragement is taken from it to continue in ſin.</hi> 'Tis the commoneſt thing in the World for ſinners to gagg their Conſciences with the mercy of God and the Death of Chriſt. <hi>They have ſinned,</hi> but <hi>God is Merciful,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt has dyed for ſinners,</hi> even for the chief of them. And upon this they quiet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs; they uſe theſe Truths as charms to caſt Conſcience into a ſleep, that it may not be diſturbed it ſelf, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb them. But ſuch would do well to conſider, that though the Scripture ſpeak glorious things of Divine
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44406:96"/> Grace and Mercy; yet there is not in the whole Book of God one promiſe of Mercy made to ſinners who are Reſolved to go on ſtill in their wickedneſs. The Lord will not ſave the ungodly <hi>in</hi> their ſins, but <hi>from</hi> their ſins; and if they will not be ſaved from Sin, they ſhall not be delivered from Wrath.</p>
            <p>Where God does proclaim his Name: <hi>The Lord Merciful and Gracious, long-ſuffering, abundant in loving kindneſs, goodneſs and truth, forgiving Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin, keeping Mercy for thouſands,</hi> to rap off the fingers of preſumptuous Souls from catching hold of what is not their Portion; 'tis added, <hi>and that will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>Guilty</hi> does not Relate unto paſt Guilt, for that is ſuppoſed in that expreſſion, <hi>Forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin.</hi> But by Guilty we are to underſtand them who are Reſolved to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract freſh guilt by an Obſtinate continuance in evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; while they are of this mind, they have nothing to do with Mercy and Chriſt, for they prefer their Luſts before both, and ſo are unlikely to be the better for either hereafter; ſince becauſe of both they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to grow worſe and worſe at preſent.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That Peace of Conſcience is falſe, <hi>where the Sinners heart is afraid of a ſearching Miniſtry.</hi> 'Tis ſaid concerning the Prophet <hi>Amos, that the Land was not able to bear his words,</hi> Amos 7. 10. Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, though <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſecure, yet their ſecurity was Carnal and groundleſs. Sincerity loves plain dealing, but Falſhood is afraid of it. If you cannot endure theſe Preachers that Rebuke ſharply, that apply home, that threaten terribly, that warn faithfully, that examine and try impartially; 'tis a ſign your Peace is Founded upon the Sand, and quickly your Building will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.

'Tis a ſtartling place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31. <hi>A wonderful and an horrible thing is committed in the Land:</hi> why, what's the Matter? <hi>The Prophets Propheſie falſly, and my People love to have it ſo.</hi> I muſt add alſo, that though you do attend upon the moſt awakening Miniſtry, if you pleaſe your ſelves with giving a bare attendance, and with countenancing the ſtricteſt ways; but in the mean while you apply Truths to others, <hi>this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns ſuch and ſuch,</hi> but take no notice how you are concerned your ſelves; let me tell you plainly, that your Peace is not right, but a moſt dangerous ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
            <p>Thus have I deſcribed and Diſcovered what is a falſe Peace of Conſcience. In the next place I am to ſhew you how unreaſonable 'tis to give Entertainment unto ſuch a kind of Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſcience is at Peace, but God ſpeaks trouble.</hi> When ſinners bleſs themſelves God curſes them; when they promiſe much good to themſelves, God threatens ten thouſand times more evil. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that the Reaſon why many ungodly ones are ſecure, is,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44406:97"/> becauſe <hi>they think God to be altogether ſuch an one as themſelves,</hi> Pſal. 50. 21. They ſee no evil in ſin, and they think the Lord ſees none neither; they love ſin, and they think God does not ſo much hate it, or at leaſt, that he will connive at <hi>their</hi> wickedneſs. Can there be a more groſs miſtake? And how unreaſonable is that Peace which is grounded upon ſuch a miſtake! No, ſecure Soul, know, God hates ſin infinitely more than thou canſt love it; and though thou flatter thy ſelf in thy own eyes for the preſent, <hi>He will Reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in Order before thee. Oh now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> All thy Bleſſing of thy ſelf cannot make thee Bleſſed; all thy promiſes to thy ſelf are vain, for thou canſt not perform one of them. But the Lord both can and will fulfill his threatnings, and cauſe the curſe denounced to overtake thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As long as a falſe Peace does laſt, <hi>Satan is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be caſt out.</hi> Awakened and troubled Souls are afraid of being under his Power, and in time look after Deliverance; but they that are ſecure, will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Baits, and follow this Enemy as long as he Sails with the ſtream of Corrupted Nature, and tempts them to that which their own wicked hearts delight in. And is it not ſad to be in poſſeſſion, and at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſo Cruel an Enemy? A Believers Heart is the Temple of the Holy Spirit, but the Heart of a wicked Man is the hole of the Old Serpent. Oh the danger that ſuch are in to be ſtung to death, and deſtroyed every moment. The Jews did boulſter up themſelves with this, That they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and they were fooliſhly confident that God was their Father: But Chriſt ſpeaks plainly, <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Luſts of your Father ye will do,</hi> John
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44406:98"/> 8. 44. The Devil is a Father to all preſumptuous ſouls, they do his Will, and will be his Prey.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This falſe Peace is <hi>very provoking, and makes the breach between God and the Sinner ſtill wider.</hi> Barely to ſin does not ſo much incenſe, as to make Light of it, and not to be troubled after ſin has been committed. The Apoſtle tells us, that mens <hi>hardneſs and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, cauſes them to treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. If a Servant commit a fault, and afterwards laugh in his Maſters Face, this is more inſufferable than the fault it ſelf. Thou that canſt forget God days without Number, and yet art at Peace; thou that canſt neglect the Lord Jeſus and his Benefits, and yet art at peace; that canſt Live without the VVord and Prayer in ſecret, and when thou prayeſt with others, thy Heart is abſent, and yet art at peace: Thou that canſt be Intemperate, Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Unclean, Covetous, Proud, Slothful, and yet art at peace: Alas, how much is God thine Enemy; how bitterly doſt thou provoke him unto Anger! The lighter ſin is made of, the heavier 'twill be ſound, and the weightier Gods indignation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This falſe Peace <hi>will be but ſhort,</hi> Job 20. 4, 5. <hi>Knoweſt not thou this of Old, ſince Man was placed upon the Earth, that the Triumphing of the wicked is but ſhort, and the Joy of the Hypocrite but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This falſe peace can laſt no longer than Life, and Life is haſting to a Concluſion, as the ſwift Ships unto the Haven, and as the Eagle does unto the Prey. How ſmall is that ſatisfaction which the hungry man takes in a Dream of a Feaſt, <hi>He Dreameth, ſaith the Prophet, and behold, he eateth, but he awaketh, and his Soul is</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:44406:98"/> 
               <hi>empty,</hi> Iſa. 29. 8. Secure Souls do Dream that God is a Friend, but when they awake they will find him an Enemy; they Dream that they are whole, but when they awake they will find that they are ſick; and if Hell wakes them they will find their caſe altogether Deſperate, and their Diſeaſe paſt Cure: They Dream that they are Rich and increaſed with good things, but when they awake they will perceive themſelves empty and miſerable. Falſe peace may fitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>a Night-viſion,</hi> for as there is no real ground for it, ſo 'tis but of very ſhort continuance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This falſe peace <hi>is threatned with ſudden deſtruction. Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 1. <hi>He that being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved hardneth his Neck ſhall ſuddenly be Deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>When they ſhall ſay, Peace and Safety, then ſudden Deſtruction cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as travel upon a Woman with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Have you never taken notice of a Man Labouring under the Falling-ſickneſs? He ſeems as well as any perſon in the VVorld, eats as heartily, walks as ſtrongly as another; but upon a ſudden down he falls, foams at Mouth, beats his Breaſt, and becomes a ſpectacle of great horror. Sinners that have a falſe Peace, look chearfully, go up and down from day to day quietly, as if no danger were near them, but at length Death ſeizeth upon them, and it ſeizeth on them ſuddenly, for it finds them utterly unprepared, and the firſt death is immediately followed by the ſecond; and if we could ſee them in Hell, Ah, how ſhould we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Caſe altered! <hi>How are they brought into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation as in a moment, and utterly conſumed with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror!</hi> Pſal. 73. 19. All their vain hope is turned into a moſt tormenting deſpair, all their falſe joy and peace
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44406:99"/> is changed into inconceivable agonies and vexation of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This falſe peace of Conſcience <hi>will very much heighten the Torment that ſhall follow.</hi> As Heaven will be the Sweeter to Believers, becauſe of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Sorrows, Sufferings, and Temptations; ſo Hell will be the more Bitter to the Ungodly, becauſe of their Confidence that they ſhould ſcape it. They that have a falſe peace, do come many of them with an expectation to have the door of Heaven open to receive them: <hi>Lord Lord open unto us,</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Lord Lord, <hi>We are at the door,</hi> and therefore let us have admiſſion into thy Kingdom. But when they find the door ſhut, and ſhut for ever againſt them; and inſtead of a place in Heaven, they are thrown down into one of the hotteſt places in Hell: Oh what weeping and wailing, will be the conſequent! Death was the worſe to the <hi>Amalekite</hi> that brought tidings of <hi>Sauls</hi> death to <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he expected a reward for his news. 'Twas more grievous to <hi>Agag</hi> to be hewed in pieces by <hi>Samuel</hi> before the Lord, <hi>when he came forth delicately, and ſaid, ſurely the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Death is paſt.</hi> So Hell will be the more intolerable unto them, who fully reckoned upon it that they were ſecured from thoſe burnings.</p>
            <p>When a ſinner that is in a falſe peace all his days, is chaſed out of the world; and beyond his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nay, contrary to his expectation is turned into a flaming Hell: We may conceive him thus ſpeaking. <hi>Little, ah little indeed, did I think that this was the place I was going to. I did not imagine the Judge had been ſo Righteous, the Trial at his Tribunal ſo Strict; and that ſo few would have been ſaved. I did not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine 'twas ſo ordinary for Souls to be deceived, and that</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:44406:99"/> 
               <hi>there was ſo much counterfeit grace in the world. I thought my ſelf ſafe, when I was fartheſt from it; and never perceived my miſtake till now 'tis too late to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it. I dreamt of Heaven, but am in the loweſt Hell; I hoped to be ſaved, but muſt be a damned wretch to all Eternity. Oh that I had waked before! How happy had I been, if a right trouble of Conſcience had been in the room of a falſe peace! Wo is me that I flattered, and by flattering did undo my ſelf! And now what courſe ſhall I take? Ah this totally confounds me, that no courſe can be taken for my relief. Heaven now I ſee, but ſo far off that I can never get thither; and out of Hell there is no Redemption.</hi> So much be ſpoken by way of reproof to them whoſe Conſciences are in peace, but that peace has no good ground upon which 'tis builded.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are to be reproved <hi>who offer violence to their Conſciences,</hi> and very ordinarily do ſin againſt them. Conſcience ſpeaks once, twice, thrice, ſpeaks in the name of the Lord, tells them of Life and Death; of the Life that will be loſt, and the Death which will be incurred by ſin; and yet theſe Tranſgreſſors go reſolutely on in an evil courſe, and hate to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They do in effect ſpeak to their Conſciences as the children of <hi>Judah</hi> did to the Prophet, Jer. 44. 16. <hi>As for the word which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</hi> Let Such conſider and that ſeriouſly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinning againſt Conſcience <hi>is the way to Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize and Sear it.</hi> 'Tis bad to have a <hi>dul Conſcience,</hi> which does its office ſo remiſsly, that no good effect at all follows; this onely Almoſt perſwades a man to that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44406:100"/> which is good, onely Almoſt diſſwades a man from that which is evil. 'Tis worſe to have a <hi>ſtupid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> which takes no notice of thouſands of ſins, unleſs ſome very crying ones be committed, and that commiſſion followed with ſome grievous Plagues. But 'tis worſt of all, to have a <hi>ſeared Conſcience;</hi> which is not at all moved though there be a giving full way to the moſt foul abomination. <note n="(y)" place="margin">

Where Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſeared, Light is extinguiſhed: there is no Grief or Shame becauſe of ſin, but an impudence and rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in evil; the mind is reprobate, and the affections vile, and iniquity is committed with Greedineſs. Even ſome Philoſophers have called this ſearedneſs <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A Sinner whoſe Conſcience is ſeared as with an hot iron, how does he ſtand ready for the Devils ſervice! and commonly he is employed in the vileſt pieces of Satans Drudgery. When <hi>Richard</hi> the third did Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his two Nephews, that he might come to the Throne; he employed a couple of villains to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate that murther, who were ſo ſenſeleſs as to ſtick at nothing. When <hi>Belzebub</hi> has any eminently and egregiouſly odious work of darkneſs to be done, he does ſet a man with a ſeared Conſcience about it; ſuch an one is likely to do the buſineſs effectually. Such Tranſgreſſors declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> they openly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44406:100"/> bid defiance to Heaven; and how ſoon may the Juſt and Jealous God by ſome remarkable ſtroke deſtroy them. What a madneſs is it to ſin againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſince this has ſo great a tendency unto the fearing of it!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sinning againſt Conſcience <hi>may bring you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</hi> If Conſcience be not ſeared by Sin, it may be ſo wounded, as that a cure may be conceived impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Soul in a great agony may cry out, <hi>My breach is wide like the Sea, and who can heal me?</hi> Great is the ſin, great is the horrour of Deſpair. What the Poet ſayes concerning <hi>Envy,</hi> may very truly be applied unto <hi>Deſperation: Siculi non invenere Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Majus tormentum.</hi> The <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrants (though infamous for their cruelty) never invented a Torment comparable. When Deſpair has once ſeized upon the Conſcience, then indeed there is Hell above ground. A Deſpairing ſinner is the trueſt and likeſt picture of a damned Reprobate. The deplorableneſs of ſuch a ſtate wherein hope leaves a ſinner, and he gives over himſelf and all for loſt, I ſhall ſet forth in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. A Deſpairing Conſcience <hi>looks upon the creatures and findes them all miſerable comforters.

Love of money had wounded him, and money it ſelf could not heal him, nor buy a medicine for him. Riches ſay to the deſpairing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; We are not able to deliver in this day of the Lords anger: Pleaſures ſay, Help is not to be found in us, 'tis not in our power to ſweeten that cup of trembling, which is filled with the wine of Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Honours and worldly Greatneſs ſay, We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not skreen thee from Him that is higher than the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and who <hi>if he will not withdraw his anger, the proudeſt helpers muſt ſtoop under him,</hi> Job. 9. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A deſpairing Conſcience <hi>remembers ſin and thoſe threatnings that are denounced againſt it, and is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed.</hi> Oh the mountains of guilt which it does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! and theſe are high; treſpaſſes are grown up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavens, and then it applies all the Curſes, all the evils that it reads in the Book of God unto it ſelf: <hi>there is a roll opened before it, written within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, with Lamentations and Mourning and Wo:</hi> to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44406:101"/> allude to that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Wherever the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing ſinner goes he is dog'd, and followed with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of ſins, and Conſcience is ſtill tormenting it ſelf with ſuch ſad thoughts. How ſhall all theſe be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for? How ſhall that vengeance be undergone which ſo many iniquities and ſo heinous, do deſerve?</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Deſpairing Conſcience <hi>looks upon Chriſt and the Goſpel, and is more than ordinarily tormented to think there is help for others, but for it ſelf none to be found.</hi> It calls to mind that once the door was open, and the ſinner was invited to come in but refuſed, but now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the door is ſhut eternally; once the Spirit ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but being reſiſted, is departed for good and all, ſo as never to return again. Once ſayes the deſpairing ſoul, I had a day of Grace, but I did not know it, I did not improve it; but now am overtaken by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Night, and ſhall never ſee day more. The Prince of Peace, the Goſpel of Peace are hid from me, the hopes of Peace are quite gone. I have outdone the very Devils themſelves, and may expect if it be poſſible, to be more miſerable; they never refuſed one offer of Mercy, but I thouſands; they never ſlighted a pardon, but I have ſlighted it, and was unwilling to be reconciled to God, they never rejected a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but I have rejected him, and preferr'd vanity, nay, ſin which is of ſuch a damnable Nature, before the only Saviour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A deſpairing Conſcience <hi>remembers Death and Judgement, and Eternity, and then there is even a Roaring out for Anguiſh,</hi> ſomething like unto the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of thoſe that actually are in the burning lake. Ah how ſhall I bear the wrath of the Almighty when all of it ſhall be ſtirr'd up? What eaſe can I expect in Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44406:102"/> Flames? How ſhall I bear the ſociety of the Devil and his Angels? How ſhall I endure to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for ever, in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb? <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. 'Tis not more certain I muſt dye, than 'tis certain I muſt be judged; 'tis not more certain I muſt be judged, than 'tis certain I muſt be damned; 'tis not more certain I muſt be damned, than 'tis certain that my damnation will be Everlaſting. This is the Language of a deſpairing ſinner: and ſince to deſpair is to be upon ſuch a wrack, how are they to be reproved that ſin againſt Conſcience which has a tendency to deſpair?</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are to be reproved, <hi>who go about to wound and to enſnare the Conſciences of Others.</hi> How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was the Apoſtle <hi>not to caſt a ſnare</hi> upon the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 35. nor to enjoyn that as neceſſary where the Lord had not impoſed a neceſſity, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after he ſticks not to ſay, that <hi>they who ſin againſt the Brethren and wound their weak Conſcience, do ſin againſt Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 12. And if I am not by an imprudent uſe of my Chriſtian liberty, to embolden another to venture upon ſin againſt Conſcience, ſurely much leſſe may I do this either by conſtraint or by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. If it argue want of Love, and be a great ſin, to impair the Eſtate, to blemiſh the reputation, to hurt the body of my Brother, how much worſe than all this, is it to wound his Conſcience? Thoſe who have no mercy to the Souls of Others, ſurely have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to their Own, and they will make bold with their own Conſciences, who have no care, no tenderneſs in reference to the Conſciences of their Brethren.</p>
            <p>Several ſorts of perſons are here concerned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injurious to others Conſciences.</p>

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:44406:102"/> 1. <hi>Falſe Prophets are injurious to the Conſciences of others:</hi> Theſe do ſpeak perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them, the Apoſtle deals very ſharply with theſe, he calls them Dogs, and bids us beware of them. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Beware of Dogs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of evil workers.</hi> No wonder that <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles them <hi>Dogs,</hi> ſince Chriſt before had call'd them <hi>Wolves,</hi> nay <hi>ravening Wolves.</hi> Falſe Prophets, eſpecially ſtrike at Conſcience, and endeavour to miſ-inform That; and if once they can prevail ſo as to make the Conſcience put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, a lye for Truth, and Truth for a Lye; how may ſouls be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away! truly ſo far at length as to fall into damnable Hereſies, and alſo into groſſe impieties and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thoſe deceived and deceiving ones ſpoken of, 2 Pet. 2. <hi>They walked in the luſts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, they counted it pleaſure to Riot, their Eyes were full of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and could not ceaſe from ſin, their Heart was exerciſed with Covetous practices, and while they talked of Liberty they were themſelves the Servants of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>

Thoſe that make the way to Heaven broad and eaſie, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration needleſs, and the Death of Chriſt an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to continue in ſin, and the Mercy of God ſo large that 'twill put up any thing, and will certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto any that cry Lord have mercy upon us: Theſe are Dawbers, enemies to Conſcience, <hi>they build a Wall, that ſhall be rent with a ſtormy wind in fury, and brought down to the ground, and they ſhall be conſumed in the midſt of it,</hi> Ezek. 13. 13. 14.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44406:103"/> and wounded, and ſecondly how wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be cured and comforted.</p>
            <p>1. How <hi>ſecure Conſciences may be awakened.</hi> Though there is many a bad Spirit which does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail at this day, yet none does more prevail than the <hi>Spirit of Slumber:</hi> cloſed Eyes, drowſie Souls, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Hearts are every where to be met with. Though ſo much hath been ſpoken, though ſo much has been done, though ſo much has been felt and ſuffered in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto our awakening; yet whoſe Conſcience is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtarled? <hi>Prophets have been full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of Judgment and of might to declare unto evil doers their Tranſgreſſion and their ſin,</hi> Mic. 3. 8. Calamity and Judgments have been ſtrange, unwonted and extraordinary, and it might have been thought that ſuch a Plague and Flames as have raged in <hi>London,</hi> would hardly have left one ſecure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but all would have learned to fear that God, who is ſo Righteous, and who knows how to take a courſe with them that provoke him unto jealouſie. But alas, like <hi>Pharoah</hi> of old, upon the <hi>leaſt reſpite</hi> the generality of ſinners do harden their Hearts, and their Conſciences ſleep ſounder than ever. Now in order unto your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakened, follow theſe directions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Think of that <hi>Great and Glorious Majeſty which by ſin is affronted, and which all the ſin that is in the World is committed againſt;</hi> He is the <hi>bleſſed and only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; he is cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honour and with Majeſty, and covers himſelf with light as with a Garment; the Heaven is his Throne, the Earth is his Foot-ſtool; the whole world in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with him is but as the Bucket, and the ſmall duſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Balance, and all the Nations of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:44406:104"/> 
               <hi>him are as nothing, and vanity,</hi> Iſa. 40. 15. 17. The greater the perſon is that is affronted, that affront is the greater crime. God is the higheſt and greateſt of all, Oh how vile and hainous a thing is it to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Sinner! would'ſt thou have thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence awakened? believe ſeriouſly that <hi>There is a God,</hi> Oh what work would this Truth make were it but firmly credited! That famous <hi>Bruce</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> who <note n="(a)" place="margin">Robertus Bruſius. <hi>Vir genere &amp; virtute nobilis, Majestate vultûs vener abilis, qui plura animarum millia Christo lucrifecit, cujus anima, ſi ullius mortalium (abſit verbo invidia) ſedet in coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
               </note> gained many thouſands of Souls to Chriſt; was wont to ſay, <hi>I think it a great matter to believe that there is a God.</hi> And not only believe that God is, but that he is ſo Glorious as his word proclaims him, this may make thee tremble.</p>
            <p>Now no ſin in the World can be committed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this God is not concerned. Thoſe ſins againſt Man, are more againſt God than againſt man: therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> after he had murthered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and defiled <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> looks beyond theſe, as high as God himſelf and cryes out, <hi>againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this Evil in thy ſight,</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. He takes notice how God was ſtruck at in that injury he had done to his Neighbour, and is wholly ſwallowed up in that conſideration, and this helped very much his awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and contrition. To how many thouſands of Millions do all thy ſins amount? and there is not one of them but has been an act of Rebellion againſt the (†) Altare Damaſcenum.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44406:104"/> Lord of Heaven, if this were pondered, it might cool thy Courage and trouble thy Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think how <hi>dreadful the Power of this God, and his wrath being joyned together muſt needs prove:</hi> in Scripture theſe two are joyned and both together are engaged againſt the ungodly, Ezra 8. 22. <hi>The hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him, but his Power and his Wrath is againſt all them that forſake him.</hi> If wrath be without Power 'tis contemptible; if Power be without wrath it may not be at all hurtful, but when Wrath and Power meet they may well be trembled at. The Wrath of a King is as the Roaring of a Lyon, as the meſſengers of Death. What then is the Anger of God? this wrath to ſhew the heat and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, is likened unto Fire, and it burns worſe than any other Fire, for it burns to Hell it ſelf, Deut. 52. 32. <hi>A Fire is kindled in mine Anger and it ſhall burn to the lowest Hell.</hi> And if you would underſtand the Power of this Anger, know that there is no withſtanding it, and Oh how diſmall are the effects of it in both Worlds!</p>
            <p>This Anger of God has brought upon ſinners Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and Vexation, and Rebuke, and has made them quickly to periſh becauſe of the Wickedneſs of their doings: it has ſmitten them with a Conſumption and a Fever, and an Inflammation, and Extreme Burning; with the Peſtilence, and Sword, and Blaſting, and Mildew, and has made the Heaven over Sinners Heads like Braſs, and the Earth under their Feet like Iron. It has made them when they went out one way againſt their Enemies, to be ſmitten and to flee ſeven wayes before them, and their carcaſſes to become meat to the Fowls of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Earth. This Anger of God has ſtricken the ungodly; with madneſs and blindneſs, and aſtoniſhment of Heart. So
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44406:105"/> that life has been a burthen, no reſt or eaſe at all could be found, ſo that in the morning they have ſaid, would God it were Evening, and in the Evening would God it were morning, becauſe of the fear and trembling of their Hearts, the failing of their Eyes, and the ſorrow of their Minds. All this is ſpoken of at large, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>But theſe are not all, nor the moſt heavy effects of Divine diſpleaſure. Indeed we are ſafe from mans Anger after Death, we cannot feel or be concerned at what Man can do when we are in the Grave. <hi>There the Wicked ceaſe from troubling, there the weary be at reſt, there the Priſoners reſt together, they hear not the voice of the oppreſſor.</hi> Job 3. 17. 18. But Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will follow after us into the other World, and then will be found moſt heavy. That Wrath to come is moſt of all amazing, for then as it will be intollerable to be born, ſo 'twil be impoſſible to be appeaſed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all this and be affrighted, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt. <hi>At thy Rebuke O God of Jacob, the ſtout Hearted are ſpoyled, none of the men of Might have found their Hands. Thou even thou art to be feared, who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art Angry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That Conſcience may be awakened, conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <hi>that you are alwayes under the Eye and Power of God, ſo that he can do with you what he pleaſes.</hi> You cannot hide your ſelves from him, nor defend your ſelves againſt him. <hi>Though you dig into Hell, thence can his hand take you, though you could climb up to Heaven,</hi> and make your neſt among the Starrs, <hi>yet thence he can bring you down, Amos</hi> 9. 2. Your breath is in His hand, dare you to provoke him? and he can take it out of your Noſtrils, without asking you leave, or giving you the leaſt warning. You have
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44406:105"/> no Leaſe of your Lives, but are Tenants at will in theſe Cottages of Clay; the Lord can turn you out, and require your Souls at your hands at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>God has moſt Sovereign Power, he is the onely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarch, becauſe all others are ſubject to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. VVhom he will he Kills, whom he will he keeps alive, whom he will he ſets up, whom he will he puts down, whom he will he ſaves, and whom, and when he will he can deſtroy for ever. <hi>He does according to his pleaſure in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay to him, What doſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4. 35. Surely 'tis not ſafe by thy ſtupidneſs of Conſcience any longer to engage this God againſt thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Firmly Believe, that <hi>'tis not more certain thou art a ſinner, than 'tis certain that the Lord of Heaven is diſpleaſed with Thee, Thee in particular.</hi> Thou that haſt an hard Heart, and a ſenſeleſs Conſcience, I am to tell thee heavy Tidings, Gods Soul does hate Thee, and he is Angry with thee every day. If God ſhould permit one of thy Old Companions in Wickedneſs to riſe from the Dead, to tell thee that his wrath abides upon thee, and that thou art making haſte unto the place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would not this ſtartle thee? Or if an Angel from Heaven ſhould meet thee with a Flaming Sword in his Hand, and tell thee, the way that thou takeſt is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe before God; and naming thy Name, <hi>John, Thomas, Richard,</hi> ſhould ſay plainly, that the Lord is thine Enemy; how would this affect thee? VVhy, the Word tells thee this; and that is <hi>a more ſure word of Prophecy.</hi> How expreſly is it ſaid, <hi>Wo to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him:</hi> Upon the wicked <hi>God ſhall rain Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an horrible Tempeſt,</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:44406:106"/> 
               <hi>this ſhall be the Portion of their Cup,</hi> Pſal. 11. 6.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Look upon <hi>God as the Lord of Hosts,</hi> that thy Conſcience may ſhrink and be afraid. Many Legions of Angels are at his Service, his beck commands them, <hi>they are his Miniſters to do his pleaſure, Pſal.</hi> 103. 21. And theſe Angels do ſo excell in ſtrength, that <hi>one of them</hi> was able to deſtroy <hi>in one Night, an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 36. All the Devils in Hell God can Employ, and they are very forward to be the Inſtruments of his Wrath and Revenge upon the workers of Iniquity. The Men of the Earth are at his Command, and he can ſtir up their Spirits, and bring whole Armies of them againſt the People of his Indignation. The Beaſts of the Field, the Fowls of the Air; nay, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Creatures he can make terrible, ſo as to tame the proudeſt of his Adverſaries. Thoſe Locuſts ſpoken of by <hi>Joel,</hi> when God does Marſhal them into an Army, how terrible are they? <hi>Like the noiſe of Chariots on the tops of Mountains ſhall they leap, like the noiſe of a Flame of Fire that devoureth the ſtubble, as a ſtrong People ſet in Battel array, before their face the People ſhall be much pained, all Faces ſhall gather blackneſs,</hi> Joel 2. 5, 6. The Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour, and Stormy Winds fulfill Gods Word. The Thunder and the Lightnings ſay unto him, <hi>Here we are;</hi> being ready to conſume the Rebellious againſt him. The Lord is very terrible in himſelf, oh dreadful to have an Omnipotent Enemy! But when beſides his own Power, he has ſo great an Hoſt at Command, how ſhould ſinners tremble before him!</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:44406:106"/> 6. Look back and ſee <hi>what Security has brought upon others.</hi> Stupidneſs of Conſcience has been the fore-runner of the moſt aſtoniſhing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ever were inflicted. Read the Story of the old World, and the Drowning of it: Was it not terrible, <hi>when all the Fountains of the great Deep were broken up, and the Windows of Heaven were opened, and the Rain was upon the Earth for forty Days and forty Nights together,</hi> Gen. 7. 11, 12? Oh, what cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what climbing was there to avoid that Deluge, but all in vain; the VVaters prevailed exceedingly, fifteen Cubits above the higheſt Mountains, and all fleſh dyed that moved upon the Earth: Fowl, Cattel, Beaſt, Creeping thing, <hi>and every Man.</hi> But Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty went before this Flood that ſwept all away. <hi>They Eat, they Drank, they Planted, they Builded, they Married, and were given in Marriage, even to the Day that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Ark.</hi> The like ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unſenſibleneſs was in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> before the Lord Rained Fire and Brimſtone, bringing Hell out of Heaven for their ſignal overthrow, who had been ſinners before the Lord exceedingly. Like ſins will have like ends; and if thy Conſcience is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were, thou mayſt be deſtroyed ſuddenly, and ſignally as they were.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That Conſcience may be awakened, conſider <hi>how unlikely 'tis that Divine Patience ſhould last much longer towards you:</hi> Do not think that his patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Enemies will be like his Mercy towards his Children, and endure for ever. You have found him long-ſuffering, 'tis Fooliſh preſumption to think he will be ever ſuffering. <hi>Laeſa Patientia fit furor,</hi> Abuſed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44406:107"/> Patience may quickly become Fury. <hi>Hippolytus,</hi>

Doſt thou think that the day of Grace will ſtill continue if it be eat and drunk, and ſlept and play'd, and ſinn'd away? Doſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how eaſie 'tis for God to deſtroy thee? And if he does it, he will eaſe himſelf of a Burthen; <hi>For he is preſſed with thy Iniquities as a Cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves,</hi> Amos 2. 13. Nay, he threatens to do it, which ſhould make thee (as ſecure as thou art) horribly afraid; concerning thoſe Sinners that did <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe</hi> and <hi>rebell;</hi> that did refuſe to turn, and did reſolve
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44406:107"/> to rebell: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts, the Mighty One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of mine Adverſaries, and avenge me on my Enemies,</hi> Iſa. 1. 24.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That Conſcience may be awakened, <hi>Behold and Know thy ſelf.</hi> To underſtand our ſelves is a great part of Wiſdom; to live and die Ignorant of our ſelves, <note n="(c)" place="margin">

They miſtake ſin, for they think it pleaſant: they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the World, for they think 'twill make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; they miſtake Satan, for they think there is no harm in yielding to his Temptations; they miſtake the Lord, for they think him an hard Maſter, and his Commands grievous; they miſtake themſelves, for they think they are what they are not, and that they are not what they are. Look therefore into your ſelves, Sinners, and there are five things you ſhould take notice of, which may help very much to ſtartle Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take Notice of <hi>your Guilt</hi> Ah, how have your offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abounded? You have Sinned alone, you have Sinned in Company, you have Sinned in every place, in every Relation, in every Capacity, in every Employment; nay, you have Sinned in every Duty that you have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God himſelf. How ſhould ſuch Guilty Souls tremble! We blame the ſtupidneſs of a Malefactor,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44406:108"/> that is in Priſon for ſeveral Crimes, the leaſt of which is enough to Hang him. Oh, blame thy ſelf for being unconcerned at thy many thouſands of Tranſgreſſions, the leaſt of which is enough to damn thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take Notice of <hi>thy weakneſs.</hi> Art thou, O Man, a Match for God? <hi>Haſt thou an Arm like the Lord? Or canſt thou Thunder with a voice like him? Canſt thou deck thy ſelf with Majeſty and Excellency, and array thy ſelf with Glory and Beauty? Canst thou cast abroad the Rage of thy Wrath, and behold every one that is proud, and abaſe him?</hi> Job 40. 9, 10, 11. Poor VVorm, thou dwelleſt in a Houſe of Clay, whoſe Foundation is in the duſt, thou art no more able to ſtand againſt God, than dryed ſtubble before devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames, or Chaff before the fierceſt VVhirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take Notice of <hi>thy Mortality:</hi> How quickly may <hi>thy breath go forth, and thou return to thy Earth, and all thy thoughts periſh? Pſal.</hi> 146. 4. How ſoon maiſt thou be hid in the duſt, and thy face bound in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret? Doſt not thou Obſerve Men as great, as young, as rich, as ſtrong as thy ſelf carried to their Graves? VVhy ſhould thy Conſcience be ſecure, as if thou wert ſure to be out of the reach of Death for theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years? It does infinitely concern thee to awake to Righteouſneſs preſently, and to work for God and for thy Soul, while 'tis day, for the Night is coming, is juſt at hand, and there is no VViſdom, nor work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Grave, whither thou art apace going.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take Notice of <hi>the Immortality of thy better</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:44406:108"/> 
               <hi>part, thy Precious Soul:</hi>

                     </gap>, that is, <hi>Tis the wicked man that is unwilling his ſoul ſhould be immortal.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> Thy Body indeed muſt lie ſenſeleſs in the Grave till the laſt day, <hi>but thy Spirit muſt return to God who gave it.</hi> As the Spirits of Juſt Men immediately after death are made perfect in the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo the ſpirits of the Ungodly are thrown into Hell when ſeparated from their Bodies; for the ſoul has been the principal ſubject of ſin, and moſt Active in wickedneſs, and therefore does more early begin to be tormented. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> are ſaid to be now <hi>ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Jude 7. which ſhews plainly, that their Souls are now in Hell, for if their Bodies and Souls were aſleep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would not truly be ſaid to ſuffer that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take notice of <hi>the eternal Duration both of Soul and Body after the Reſurrection:</hi> Body and Soul, which Death does part, muſt be joyned again; and as they have been Companions together in Sin, ſo they muſt ſhare together in Everlaſting Puniſhment. Thou maiſt be weary of thy Being, ſinner, and wiſh thou hadſt never had it, or that it might be taken away; but thy wiſh will not be granted. Thou muſt endure as long as God does, and ſince thou muſt Be for ever, Awake, awake, that thou maiſt not <hi>be for ever miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. That Conſcience may be awakened, <hi>Behold how the Judge ſtands before the Door,</hi> James 5. 9. the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord draws nigh, and is ſtill nearer and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44406:109"/> nearer. <hi>Yet a little while and he that ſhall come will come and will not tarry,</hi> Heb. 10. 37. Oh think of that day when the World ſhall be on Fire about your Ears, when the Lord ſhall come with Clouds and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eye ſhall ſee Him, and all the kindreds of the earth ſhall wail becauſe of him; when the Sun ſhall become black as a ſackcloth of hair, and the Moon ſhall be like blood; when the Heaven ſhall depart as a ſcroll when 'tis rolled together, and every Mountain and Iſland ſhall be removed out of their places; when the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſit upon his great white Throne, and all the dead both ſmall and great ſhall ſtand before him, and ſhall be judged according to their works, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11. 12. Conſider ſeriouſly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How <hi>glorious the Judge will be at that day:</hi> he will come attended with Legions of Angels. Oh the Majeſty and Brightneſs of our Lord, when he ſhall appear the ſecond time! he appeared the firſt time in the form of a Servant, becauſe he was to be obedient unto Death for the ſins of men; but then he will be ſeen as he is, 'twill be evident to all, that he is the Son of God, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Brightneſs of his Fathers glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How <hi>powerful will this Judge be found!</hi> All the Devils, and the Reprobate world will be then toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet they will not be able to make their part good againſt him; but he will Judge and Condemn, and put the Sentence which he paſſes upon them, in Execution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How <hi>Righteous will the whole proceeding of this Judge at that day be!</hi> Every mouth ſhall be ſtopt, and every ſinner ſpeechleſſe. Oh then the Evil of ſin will
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44406:109"/> be made Manifeſt; and how Righteous 'tis for the Lord, to Sentence the Wicked unto Everlaſting Fire. Whom He Condemns, every one will Condemn; and they ſhall not chooſe but Condemn themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After the Judge has paſt Sentence, <hi>he will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable:</hi> no Cryes, no Tears will prevail with him to Repeal it. Thoſe that then are Condemned, can never be Juſtified, can never be ſaved. Oh what is that Miſery which is Extream, as to the Meaſure; and as to the Duration of it, Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thou in Particular muſt give Account of thy ſelf unto this Judge. All muſt appear before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt, and that <hi>All</hi> includes thee. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us muſt give account of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14. 12. And Oh ſecure ſinner, if all muſt be judged according to their Works, begin now to tremble that thy works have been all ſo bad; what kind of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is likely to be paſt upon thee? Is thy World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Uncleanneſs, and neglect of God and Chriſt and Duty; and thy ſtupidneſs of Conſcience, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, likely to be rewarded with Heaven? No, no, that which is thy due (and thy due ſhall be given thee) is everlaſting Deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his Power.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Take ſome encouragement, <hi>that 'tis not too late to awake as yet, though Conſcience hitherto has ſlept ſecurely.</hi> Thy Glaſſe is not yet run, thy Sun is not yet ſet, thy Day is not yet ended; there may be poſſibly an Inch of thy Span of time remaining; Oh ſleep no longer, but up and be doing thy main buſineſs.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44406:110"/> When the ſhip was drowning the Marriners come to <hi>Jonah,</hi> with a juſt rebuke, <hi>What meaneſt thou O ſleeper?</hi> Jon. 1. 6. When Souls are ſinking, and when ſinners are damning, there is much more reaſon to ſay to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, what meaneſt Oh Sleeper! Awake before it be quite too late. Call upon God to awaken you throughly; he can make the ſleepy, nay, the dead to hear his voice: <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> So much be ſpoken (and Lord make what has been ſpoken Effectual!) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken ſecure Conſciences.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place I am to ſhew how wounded and awakened Conſciences, may be Cured and Comforted. And here it will be needfull firſt to ſhew you ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about trouble of Conſcience, which are very common; Secondly to diſcover when Conſcience is troubled after a right manner; Thirdly how Comfort is to be applied in that trouble.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, namely, <hi>the miſtakes about trouble of Conſcience;</hi> they are theſe following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is not right trouble of Conſcience <hi>which is onely the product of, and laſts no longer than Affliction.</hi> When <hi>Pharoah</hi> was under the ſmart of the Rod, he cryed out I have ſinned; but this was not real trouble for ſin, for as ſoon as ever the Rod is taken off, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> is as reſolved to ſin as ever. The mettal while the Fire burns, is Liquid, and you may caſt it into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny form; but take away the Fire, and it becomes hard as ever. Such kind of mettall are many hearts, while in the Furnace of Affliction, how melted and tender
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44406:110"/> do they ſeem; but when taken out of that Furnace, then they quickly cool and become perhaps more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate than before. Who would have thought (though ſo indeed it was) that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who when God ſlew them, did ſeek him, and returned and enquired early after him, and remembred that he was their Redeemer and their Rock; ſhould all this while <hi>onely flatter him with their Lips, and that their Hearts ſhould not be right with him nor ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That is not right trouble of Conſcience <hi>which is onely ſorrow after the world:</hi> 
               <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Triſtitia mundi eſt quum propter terrenas afflictiones ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos deſpondent &amp; luctu opprimuntur; triſtitia autem ſecundum Deum quae Deum reſpicit, dum unicam miſeriam ducunt excidiſſe à Dei gratiâ; ac timore judicii ejus perculſi, peccata ſua lugent.</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</note> this kind of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is ſo far from having a promiſe of life made to it, that the Apoſtle affirms, <hi>it works death,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 10. There is a great ſorrow in thy Heart, and it appears in thy very looks, but what is the cauſe of it? If hard times trouble thee, but an hard Heart is no affliction; if croſſes and loſſes in the World perplex thee, but the loſſe of thy Soul, is not at all feared, neither is there any care taken to prevent it; if thy poverty in the World do grieve thee, but thou doſt not ſorrow at all becauſe deſtitute of the true Riches, how canſt thou call any of this a right trouble? The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did weep and <hi>Howl,</hi> but the cauſe was, they wanted <hi>Corn and Wine,</hi> and ſo they had but theſe things in Plenty, they could be well contented to live without God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 13, 14. Every penſive ſinner is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44406:111"/> nor fit to be comforted; their very penſiveneſs is a very great ſin, as long as ſin is not, but only worldly croſſes the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That is not right trouble of Conſcience, where <hi>there is onely a ſlaviſh fear of puniſhment, but love to ſin does ſtill remain in ſtrength.</hi> Where there is ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear and no more, there is an hatred of God, and a ſecret wiſh to get from under his Power, the ſlave you know hates his Maſter, and wiſhes he might be at liberty, and never ſee or ſerve him more: there is alſo an hatred of the Commands of God, and a repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and murmuring at the ſtrictneſs of them. Sin is dear as ever, &amp; a grief there is becauſe of thoſe threats which terrifie and hinder the free commiſſion of it. If ſuch a Soul might have its wiſh, It ſhould not be <hi>Oh that I might be turned to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that my wayes were directed to keep his Statutes!</hi> but it ſhould be, <hi>Oh that I might have liberty to do as I liſt,</hi> and that there were no ſuch thing as the Word and Will of God to be obſerved! where ſuch a Spirit is (which the Heart-ſearching God perfectly underſtands) abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the outward act of ſin, ſignifies not much. The Merchant in a Storm cannot be ſaid to hate his goods, becauſe he flings them overboard, he is ſorry becauſe driven to ſuch a ſtrait: and when he comes aſhore wiſhes as much for his goods as ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That is not right trouble of Conſcience, <hi>which Sinners being impatient under, do fly for Comfort to the Creatures.</hi> If thou art indeed wounded, the ſame hand that gave the wound muſt bind it up, <hi>I wound, and I heal,</hi> ſays God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39. If ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, if Sports and Paſtimes, if carnal Company, if immerſing thy ſelf in worldly buſineſs can divert, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44406:111"/> by degrees chaſe away thy trouble, 'tis a ſign 'twas never true. Right ſorrow is not aſſwaged but by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual means. 'Twas a wiſe courſe and reſolution of thoſe, Hoſ. 6. 1. <hi>Come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath ſmitten and he will bind us up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That is not right trouble of Conſcience, <hi>where there is an utter deſpair of Mercy. Cain</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſo was <hi>Judas,</hi> and the trouble of both (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the latter) was unconceivably great, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ſpoyl'd it. I grant indeed that ſouls truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may have Temptations, and very ſtrong ones to deſpair, but there is an unſeen hand in their greateſt Terrors and Dejections, which keeps them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed up in that gulph quite, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are upon the brink of it. <hi>Cranmer</hi> in his laſt Prayer cryes out, <hi>I have ſinned more than Tongue is able to expreſs, but ſhall I deſpair? God forbid. Thou art a Gracious Lord, and thy Mercy does thruſt away none who ask for a Remedy of ſin, and comfort in their miſery.</hi> Deſpair does thwart the deſign of the Goſpel which is to extoll the <hi>Riches of Divine Grace, as ſuper abounding, where ſin has moſt abounded;</hi> and to ſet forth Chriſt <hi>as a Saviour to the uttermoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Spirit does give a ſight of ſin, he opens a door of hope, and lets in a beam of Light, whereby <note place="margin">

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:44406:112"/> the poſſibility of Mercy is diſcovered. The trembling Gaoler, did not ſay, <hi>I am ſure I ſhall be damned,</hi> but <hi>what ſhall I do that I may be ſaved?</hi> Act. 16. 30. this very inquiry ſhews that ſome poſſibility of Salvation was conceived. Satan indeed endeavours to ſhut the door of hope, and to overwhelm the Soul, but he is not to be harkned to Satan put it into the Heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, and afterwards he put it into his Heart to deſpair, and how effectual was his deſpair to his deſtruction. By no means therefore entertain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing thoughts, for they come from Hell and lead thither.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That is not right trouble of Conſcience <hi>which is onely the effect of prevailing Melancholy.</hi> This hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour prevails exceedingly at this day, and thoſe who never had experience of it cannot imagine the torment that is in it. <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeaks feelingly, <hi>No torture of Body like unto it; strappadoes, hot Irons,</hi> Phalaris <hi>Bulls are not comparable. All Fears, Griefs, Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Diſcontents, as ſo many ſmall brooks are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up and drown'd in this</hi> Euripus, <hi>this Iriſh Sea, this Ocean of miſery. This is the Quinteſſence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Adverſity: all other Diſeaſes whatſoever are but flea-bitings to Melancholy in extent, 'tis the pith of them all. A Melancholy man is that true</hi> Prometheus, <hi>which is bound to</hi> Caucaſus, <hi>the true</hi> Tityus, <hi>whoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells are ſtill devoured by a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulture, for he is fed upon by Anxieties and Griping cares continually.</hi> But though Melancholy be ſo tormenting, it very much differs from trouble of Conſcience, and is not ſo intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. You will ask me how Melancholy and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual trouble differ? before I tell you how, I would lay down two things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:44406:112"/> 1. 'Tis an Argument of an <hi>Ignorant and Profane Spirit, to ſay, that all trouble of Conſcience is nothing elſe but Melancholy.</hi> Such who are of this mind, do make a mock of ſin, and of the Convictions of the Spirit, and of the terrors of the Lord, and ſlight the great Phyſitian of Souls: for if all trouble be from Humours in the Body, other Phyſitians may ſerve the turn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Melancholy and trouble of Conſcience are <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times joyned together;</hi> and they may be mutually the Occaſion of each others increaſe. If the Conſcience be wounded, and the Body Diſtempered with this black Humour at the ſame time, Satan has the greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The ſoul will not eaſily admit of Comfort, but is more inclined to meditate terror; and the wounds of Conſcience will be the more ſmarting, and longer before Cured.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſhew the difference between trouble of Conſcience and Melancholy, in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Melancholy the <hi>Body may plainly be perceived to be out of Order;</hi> either no ſleep at all, or a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual drouſineſs, the Spleen ſwelled or pained, a ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſtomach, and a Cloud ſeems to dwell in the Brain. But trouble of Conſcience may be, and is found in thoſe who are of the moſt excellent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and even in the time of the firmeſt Health. The Goalor, 'tis very likely, had a ſtrong Body, and no Diſtemper that we read of upon him; yet his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is wounded, and how ſollicitous is he to eſcape Hell!</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Melancholy <hi>there is great Confuſion;</hi> no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account can be given of trouble. The Soul is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44406:113"/> like one in the dark, or that is blind-fold, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly buffeted, but knows neither the Hand nor the Inſtrument from whence his ſmart comes. But a troubled Conſcience can eaſily aſſign a cauſe of its trouble. Ask the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> the reaſon of his trouble, he will Anſwer, <hi>I was a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecutor, and Injurious.</hi> Demand of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> what Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted them? They will Anſwer, they had been <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 6. 9. Troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſouls do underſtand their Guilt and Plagues.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Melancholy <hi>the great thing deſired is eaſe and quiet,</hi> that the horrible darkneſs may be diſpelled, and the former ſerenity may return. But in right trouble of Conſcience, not onely Peace, but Peace upon a good ground is longed for; the preſent trouble is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before ſecurity in wickedneſs, that was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Ay, and Grace as well as Peace is begged.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44406:113"/> is ſome ſtinging and perplexing thought which renders Life and all the enjoyments of it bitter and uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. But trouble of Conſcience is more without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion; it does not depend upon the ebbing or flowing of any Humour in the Body. Load is laid on by the Spirit of God, and the burthen preſſes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally untill the Comforter take it off. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, that <hi>his ſore ran in the Night, and ceaſed not,</hi> Pſal. 77. 2.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Melancholy makes a <hi>Man to fear every thing almoſt, though there be no juſt ground of fear.</hi> VVhen he goes to Bed he fears he ſhall die in his ſleep, and not Live till Morning: Though in never ſo good a Trade, he fears that God will blaſt him in his Eſtate, and that he ſhall fall into extream poverty. Melancholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are tortured with a fear of being Diſtracted, and running ſtark Mad many times; and then they think what a ſad ſpectacle they ſhall be when they are in <hi>Bedlam;</hi> and if Profeſſors, how much Religion will be Reproached upon their Account. Many times they fear the appearing of the Devil in ſome terrible ſhape, and that thereby they ſhall be frighted out of their wits. 'Tis ordinary for them to have ſad fore-boding thoughts of ill to themſelves; as that ſome grievous Calamity is not far off from them, or theirs, and that their lives will be very ſhort, and within a little while they ſhall be in another VVorld. They can hardly hear of any that have Hang'd or Drown'd themſelves, but they fear <note n="(g)" place="margin">Quos malè habet hic morbus, triſtes ſunt &amp; ſolitarii, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miduloſi, &amp; pertinaces, phantaſias quaſdam ſibi faciunt quae nec ſunt, nec eſſe poſſunt, falſa multa imaginantur, timent non metu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda, ſine cauſâ moerent animumque macerant.</note> they ſhall do the like one time or other.

            <p>But a troubled Conſcience <hi>eyes and fears the Wrath of an Almighty God,</hi> and that principally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 7. <hi>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou haſt afflicted me with all thy waves, Selah.</hi> And v. 16, 17. <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy terrors have cut me off, they came round about me daily like water, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about together.</hi> 'Tis not Poverty, Diſgrace, Death that is ſo much dreaded, but a Jealous, and highly provoked God is terrible: and therefore when the Lord promiſes to revive ſuch Conſciences, he ſays, he will ceaſe to be Angry, and to contend, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 16. <hi>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wrath, leſt the Spirit fail before me and the Souls which I have made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. In Melancholy <hi>there are ſtrange hurryings in the Heart;</hi> 'tis ſnatched and carried away, and ſome <hi>amazing thoughts are upon a ſudden injected about Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things;</hi> but there is no <hi>Scripture-ground</hi> alledged for them Some under this Diſtemper will cry out, they are meer Hypocrites; and as if they had look'd into the black Book of Gods Reprobation, will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily ſay, their Names have been written there from everlaſting. Others will cry out, that the day of Grace is paſt and gone, and that God has ſworn concerning them in his wrath, that they ſhall never enter into his Reſt. Now, as the God of Heaven does walk upon the Wings of the Wind, ſo Satan, the God of this World, does walk upon theſe Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick winds, mixes himſelf with them, and terrifies the Soul with the fear of Damnation. And oh with
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44406:114"/> what aſtoniſhment does a poor Melancholick Creature think of being damned everlaſtingly! Many times Satan tells them, that the longer they Live, they will but fill the Vial fuller of wrath, and but add more fewel to that Fire, which muſt be their Portion for ever, and hereupon follow temptations to ſelf-murther; and upon all convenient Occaſions, when they are alone, by Water, or ſee a Rope, or a Knife, <hi>Do it, Do it,</hi> is violently urged in upon them. But if you ask theſe Melancholy ſouls, why they conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Hypocrites and Reprobates; not one Scripture can they produce to prove it.</p>
            <p>VVhereas on the other ſide, in trouble of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Conviction is plainly grounded on the word of God. The awakened VVorldling hears his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs called Idolatry;</hi> the awakened VVhore-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger perceives evidently that <hi>no unclean Perſon ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God.</hi> The awakened Swearer reads that his Oaths will <hi>make him fall into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> They believe thoſe threats, and know that they are guilty, therefore they are Afflicted, and look out after a Remedy, and cry to be turned from their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and Reconciled unto God.</p>

The whole Colledge of Phyſitians would be here at a loſs. VVhen the <hi>Italian</hi> Doctors came to Viſit <hi>Spira</hi> in his diſtreſs, He ſpake theſe words: <hi>Alas, poor Men, how</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:44406:115"/> 
               <hi>far wide are you? Do you think that this Diſeaſe is to be Cured by Potions? Believe me, there must be another manner of Medicine: It is neither Plaiſters nor Drugs that can help a fainting Soul, caſt down with the ſenſe of ſin, and the wrath of God. 'Tis onely Chriſt that muſt be the Phyſitian, and the Goſpel the Soul-Antidote.</hi> But here I muſt add, that where the trouble is mixt, partly from Melancholy and partly from a wounded Conſcience, proper Phyſick, (and eſpecially a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Diet and Exerciſe) muſt be uſed for the one, as the blood of Chriſt is the alone ſutable Remedy for the other.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Melancholy alone <hi>never alienates the Heart from ſin.</hi> Several that Labour under this diſtemper, in their lucid intervals will be as vain as any; nay, ſometimes they have ſtrange and ſtrong inclinations to Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and too much yield unto them; they will moſt Prodigally miſpend their time, which is much more precious than Gold that periſhes, and exceedingly give way to ſenſuality, and the pretence is their Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. VVhen in their doleful fits they have been afraid of Hell, and have concluded they ſhould be damned as certainly as either <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas;</hi> yet when that fit of Melancholy is over, how will they yield unto Temptation! they are as proud as before, as paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and worldly as ever, and none of this troubles them. This Malady alſo does mightily indiſpoſe them to Duty, it makes the Heart like a ſtock or ſtone: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this blockiſhneſs, where there is Grace, is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; but in others not ſo. Duty onely is a Burthen, not their indiſpoſition to it.</p>
            <p>But now trouble of Conſcience, if right, helps much to break that League between the Soul and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; it cauſes great tenderneſs and fear of ſin,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44406:115"/> and very much incites to Prayer and other Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God has Commanded, and wherein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him is to be enjoyed. 'Twas ſaid of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> as ſoon as the Lord had ſtruck him to the ground, and he was prickt in his heart <hi>Behold he Prayeth,</hi> Acts 9. 11. <hi>When the Waters,</hi> that is, troubles, <hi>came into</hi> David's <hi>Soul, when he was ſinking in the deep Mire, where there was no ſtanding,</hi> how earneſtly does he cry out, <hi>Save me, O God!</hi> Nay, he <hi>did cry till his Throat was dryed,</hi> and <hi>though his eyes failed, yet he waited for the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 69. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken of the miſtakes about trouble of Conſcience;</p>
            <p>I am in the Second place to diſcover, when Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is troubled after a right manner, ſo as that it may be proper to apply Comfort from the Goſpel. This right trouble I ſhall ſet forth in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some ſpecial ſin, perhaps, more hainous than Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, is uſually at firſt Diſcovered, and charged home by the Spirit upon the Conſcience.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> before his Converſion, was Riding to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> but the Lord met him in the way, and the firſt ſin he was charged with, was that of Perſecuting the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4. <hi>As he journied, and came near</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>ſuddenly their ſhined round about him a Light from Heaven, and he fell to the Earth, and heard a Voice, ſaying unto him,</hi> Saul, Saul, <hi>why Perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Thoſe Jews that were awakened by <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, were charged <hi>with taking Chriſt, and Crucifying, and ſlaying him with wicked hands,</hi> Acts 2. 23. Thus the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who had had five Husbands, is told of her Living in Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44406:116"/> with <hi>a man that was not her Husband, John</hi> 4. 18. Thus commonly the work begins; ſome more groſſe ſin, as lying, ſwearing, drunkenneſs, ſelf-pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or the like is diſcovered, and that is like a dart ſhot in the Conſcience; cauſing a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cannot eaſily be ſhaken off. <note n="(i)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. After one ſin is diſcovered and Conſcience begins to be perplexed, <hi>innumerable other tranſgreſſions are brought to remembrance.</hi> Juſt as when a debtor is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by one Creditor, all the others are ready to come upon him. The Eye of Conſcience being truly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee one ſin, preſently is able to diſcern thouſands. <hi>David</hi> after his being awakened by the Prophet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> looks firſt upon his filthineſs and blood guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but a great many other ſins alſo ſtared him in the Face. Therefore as a man beſet by all together, he cryes out for the pardon of all, Pſal. 51. 9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins, blot out all my Tranſgreſſions,</hi> Oh how did his iniquities ſwarm about him and ſting him, when he ſaid, Pſal. 40. 12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, my iniquities have taken hold upon me that I am not able to look up, they are more than the hairs of my Head therefore my Heart faileth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Where right trouble of Conſcience is, the <hi>impure ſtreams are traced up to the fountain,</hi> and the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature is acknowledged and bewailed. Contrite <hi>David</hi> lookt thus farr, Pſal. 51. 5. <hi>Behold I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> took notice of that evil which was preſent with him, which was ſo great an impediment
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44406:116"/> unto his doing of good, Rom. 7. How can we be rightly humbled till this Corruption of Nature be ſeen? but when we perceive that Satan is not principally to be blamed for our wickedneſſes, but our own ſelves, and that what does defile us does not come from <hi>below,</hi> but from <hi>within,</hi> this will make us to be filled with the greater ſelf abhorrency. <hi>Every man is Tempted,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>James, when he is drawn away of his own Luſt and inticed,</hi> chap. 1. 14. <hi>Evil Thoughts, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Murthers</hi> and ſuch like Abominations, Chriſt tells us, proceed out of our <hi>own Hearts,</hi> Math. 15. 19. Oh this does exceedingly afflict the Soul which is rightly troubled; that all thoſe thouſands of ſins which have been committed, are but the offspring of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Heart and Nature, and not one is to be laid at any other door.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Conſcience when rightly troubled <hi>is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of that ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, and the great Evil that is in it.</hi> 'Tis the work of the Spirit to convince the World of Sin and Unbelief is eſpecially diſcovered, John 16. 8, 9. <hi>When the Comforter is come he will reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment; of Sin becauſe they Believe not on Me.</hi> Not believing in Chriſt is a great ſin in it ſelf, and it binds all the ſinners other iniquities faſt upon him, <note n="(k)" place="margin">

'Tis a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44406:117"/> damning thing to tranſgreſſe the Law; but to be deaf to the Goſpel, and to reject Chriſt is a great deal worſe, for this is to ſin againſt a Remedy, and to ſlight an offer of Life and Peace. How Glorious is God in his dear Son! how does his Wiſdome, and Power, and Grace, and Love, and Righteouſneſs, and Truth ſhine forth in him! now notwithſtanding all this to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Chriſt, not to Reverence the Son, not to receive him though he offers benefits of ineſtimable value, this muſt needs encreaſe guilt, and heighten wrath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. If a Prince ſhould, after his ſubjects had played the Rebels, and he had them at his Mercy; offer a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to them, and they ſhould refuſe it and chuſe rather to continue rebels ſtill; their not accepting the Princes Clemency, would incenſe him more to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than their forgoing Rebellion. We are ready to pity <hi>Tantalus, (l)</hi> who as <hi>Homer</hi> ſayes was thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; he ſtood in a lake with Water up to his chin, but when ever he ſtoopt to quench his thirſt with the water, it preſently ſunk away from him.

But now let us ſuppoſe that the water might have been drunk, and <hi>Tantalus</hi> would not have ſtoopt a little for it, and that Fruit might have been eaten, but though it grew within his reach, he would not have been at the pains to have ſtretched forth his hand to pluckt it: Who would have pitied <note place="margin">

               <hi>Tantalus</hi> then? every one would have blamed his folly in not taking what was brought ſo neer to him. This is the caſe of the Unbeliever, <hi>the Word is nigh him,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. Chriſt is nigh him, the Bread and Water of life is brought to his very mouth, but he will taſte of neither, though he ſo much needs both, and may have both free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>The Conſcience therefore is troubled for unbelief, for the ſinners rejecting Chriſt in times paſt, that when ſuch great Salvation was offered, it ſhould be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the Lord Jeſus ſhould ſtand ſo long and knock ſo often at the door, but it was kept ſhut and barr'd againſt him. Oh 'twere juſt ſayes the ſinner, for Chriſt to go away, and never to give ſo much as one knock at my Heart again, and, now I ſee my Need of his Salvation, utterly to deny that Salvation to me.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the Conſcience is rightly troubled. <hi>The Anger of the Lord, and the Curſe of his Law are a very great burthen.</hi> Sin has been committed, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Holy, Juſt and Good have been tranſgreſſed, and Chriſt who alone can appeaſe Divine Anger, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie for tranſgreſſion, and Mediate a Peace, has been contemned; well therefore may the Sinner be afraid. How great and how fierce is this wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty! there is never a ſingle ſin but makes the ſinner liable to the Curſe of the Law, and how Curſed a wretch, do iniquities ten thouſand times ten thouſand, many times told, render him? every tranſgreſſion makes the Lord Angry, to how great an height then is that anger by Millions of tranſgreſſions raiſed! The awakened ſinner ſees the Lord whetting his glittering Sword, and his hand taking hold of vengeance, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fear does come upon him, and pain as of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44406:118"/> in travel. How ſcalding are the Drops of the Lords wrath, what then are the full ſhowers? If God run upon any like a Gyant they muſt needs be broken with breach upon breach.</p>
            <p>I dare not ſay that the anger of the Lord does lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like heavy upon all awakened Conſciences and truly humbled Souls, nor that theſe terrors of Soul are equal in all that are brought home to Chriſt. Though all humbled ſinners are made with <hi>Ephraim</hi> to bemoan themſelves, yet ſome are made to bemoan themſelves much longer, and much louder than others. <hi>Levi</hi> taken from the Receipt of Cuſtom, and <hi>Lydia,</hi> felt not that we read of, ſuch Agonies and Terrors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as Perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> and the trembling Gaoler. All the veſſels of Mercy are not of the ſame temper, and that which <hi>cannot abide the Fire,</hi> 'tis ſufficient that, as under the Old Law, <hi>it paſſe through the Water,</hi> Numb. 31, 23. As to theſe Legal terrors I would ſay theſe five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe <hi>terrors in themſelves are a puniſhment,</hi> and therefore not to be deſired in ſo great a degree, we are not to be fond of them, though when they are upon us, we muſt deſire ſupport under them, and that they may proſper unto the end whereunto they are appointed, namely, to wean us from our luſts, and drive us out of our ſelves, unto the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Terrors being a Puniſhment, ſurely are not ſaving Grace.</hi> Reprobates have had them in a great meaſure. O <hi>Judas!</hi> thou hadſt an Hell upon Earth by Reaſon of legal Horror, before thou wenteſt to thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place: and 'tis poſſible to exceed in regard of theſe. Therefore the Apoſtle takes care in reference to the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian, that he ſhould not be</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:44406:118"/> 
               <hi>ſwallowed up with over much ſorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Barely from theſe Terrors of the Law, <hi>none can conclude that they ſhall certainly be joined to the Lord Jeſus.</hi> They are not alwayes fore-runners of Faith, but ſometimes they iſſue in deſpair, and ſometimes they wear off, and ſinners become more hardened and confirmed in their wickedneſs. Thus it was with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> notwithſtanding all his trouble and fear at ſome times of the Lords anger.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe that complain <hi>for want of theſe legal Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are really under them</hi> in a more remiſſe degree, for thoſe who are perplexed with doubts and fears about their Eternal ſtate, and think becauſe they never were ſufficiently troubled, that they never yet cloſed with Chriſt, what are theſe afraid of but Gods anger, and his Curſe which by ſin has been deſerved?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do not go about <hi>to direct or Counſell the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> If he bring thee home by a more gentle way, &amp; give thee a ſight of thy Remedy as ſoon almoſt as of thy ſin &amp; miſery thou haſt the more cauſe to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but withal to be the more vigilant and watchful; for if wrath has not lain ſo hard upon thee, thou wilt be the more ſubject to make bold with ſin afterward, and art not likely to be ſo fearful to incurre Divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the future.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Where the Conſcience is rightly troubled, <hi>the ſinner is filled with grief and ſhame becauſe of 'its ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> God complains of the Children of <hi>Iſrael, that they were Impudent and hard hearted. Ezek.</hi> 3. 7. But the troubled Soul is confounded before God, the humbled ſinner thinks thus, that if the World did know
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44406:119"/> all the ſins which he has been guilty of, he ſhould be ready to wiſh himſelf out of the World, but Gods knowledge ſignifies more than if All Creatures were acquainted with his abominations. I do not wonder at that expreſſion, Jer. 3. ult. <hi>We lye down in our own ſhame, and our confuſion covereth us.</hi> How foul does ſin make us! how unlike to God! how monſtrouſly to reſemble the unclean Spirit! what high and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ingratitude is there in ſin! is this the requital for all the Lords goodneſs? is this the return for millions of mercies? ſhame upon this grows great, and ſorrow goes hand in hand with it. We read <hi>that a voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and ſupplication of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the Lord their God,</hi> Jer. 3. 21. <hi>Behold O Lord,</hi> ſayes the Church, <hi>for I am in diſtreſſe, my bowels are troubled, my heart is turned within me;</hi> why what ails her? <hi>I have grievouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled,</hi> this made <hi>her ſighes many, and her Heart faint,</hi> Lam. 2. 20, 22. Sin does beſt deſerve ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ſo great an evil, and there is ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Scripture here to ſpend our grief.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44406:120"/> Ignorant Beaſts before God; all this has ſhewed how they have diſliked and abhorred themſelves.</p>
            <p>And as they have accuſed, ſo they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to paſs a Judgment, and to condemn themſelves. VVhen the Jews Crucified Chriſt, they accuſed him, cryed out againſt him, as a Deceiver, and condemned him to that Ignominious Death. Troubled ſouls deal thus with the Fleſh, and its Luſts and Affections: They accuſe the Fleſh, as being enmity againſt God; they cry out, that they have been deceived by the Fleſh, and they condemn the Luſts of it to be Crucified and ſlain; and further ſay, becauſe the Fleſh has been pleaſed and ſerved, they themſelves deſerve to be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned. In the greateſt ſeverities they cry out, <hi>the Lord is Righteous;</hi> nay, if he ſhould inflict the Vengeance of eternal flames upon them, they grant his ways would be but very equal.</p>

               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:44406:121"/> The ſinner ſees evidently that he has been groſſely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his Luſts, and wofully deceived by them. They promiſed him pleaſure, but have paid him in Gall and VVormwood; they promiſed him profit, but have undone him; he has none of the true and enduring Riches, and his Soul is in great danger of being loſt for ever; hereupon he is not ſo fond of them as before: His Love abates, and begins to be turned into averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Hatred. <hi>He ſays, I have ſinned, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that which is right, and it has not profited me,</hi> Job. 33. 27. nay, inſteed of profiting, it has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly Miſchievous; and now ſin begins to be lookt upon with an ill eye. VVhen <hi>Ephraim</hi> perceived that his Idols could not help him, nay, provoked the Lord unto Jealouſie and Anger againſt him, he flings them away to the Bats and to the Moles, as things unworthy to be VVorſhipt, or ſo much as look on; and ſays, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> Hoſ. 14. 8. Then trouble does work kindly when ſin it ſelf is diſliked, and the ſoul with an indignation and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on crys out, what have I to do any more with ſo great an evil?</p>
            <p n="10">10. When Conſcience is rightly troubled, <hi>the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is very inquiſitive to underſtand what he muſt do to be ſaved.</hi> Thus the Gaoler, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30. <hi>came trembling, and fell down before</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas, <hi>and brought them out, and ſaid, Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Now, when they heard this, they were prickt in their heart, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> And <hi>Saul,</hi> as ſoon as throughly awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is at the ſame enquiry, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. <hi>And he tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> The Queſtion is no longer, Who will ſhew
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44406:121"/> us any of the Worlds good? The Queſtion is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, What ſhall we eat, or what ſhall we drink, or wherewith ſhall we be cloathed? But the main enquiry is, What courſe muſt be taken to have ſin covered? Gods anger removed, the immortal and precious Soul ſaved? That is, delivered from everlaſting burnings, and brought to an incorruptible Inheritance. Theſe are the chief Matters which all ſhould mind, and truly they who think it not worth the while to enquire about Salvation, 'tis a ſign they have not ſet ſo much as one ſtep in the way to it, but all their days their feet have been going down to Death and Hell.</p>
            <p n="11">11. VVhere Conſcience is rightly troubled, <hi>the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners heart will conſent to any Conditions and terms of Peace and Reconciliation with God.</hi> There is a Beam of Spiritual Light which ſhines into his Soul, ſo that he ſees all things after another manner to what he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. He ſees God to be another kind of Foe and Friend than heretofore he thought him, and Chriſt to be a better Lord and Maſter than heretofore he did imagine. He comes to God, and ſays, <hi>Lord, be Merciful, be my Father, and let the Lord Jeſus become a Saviour to me; and write down what Articles thou pleaſest, I will ſubſcribe them, onely help me to do it with my very Heart.</hi> VVhen he hears that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Caſt away every Tranſgreſſion,</hi> he preſently crys out, <hi>Lord, let not any Iniquity have the dominion over me.</hi> VVhen he hears that all the Precepts of the Lord are to be kept diligently, he crys out, <hi>Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes.</hi> VVhen he hears of the Neceſſity of Converſion, he crys out, <hi>Turn thou me, O Lord, and I ſhall be turned.</hi> VVhen he hears what 'twill coſt to be Chriſt's Diſciple, and how he muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44406:122"/> cryes out, Oh, let me never be Offended, but count all things loſs, that I may win Chriſt. The Chimes do not more preſently follow the Clock, than the truly humbled Soul does upon its underſtanding the will of God, deſire to ſubmit unto it. 'Tis willing to do any thing, to be any thing, to bear any thing, to forbear any thing, ſo the favour of God, and an Intereſt in the Lord Jeſus may be Obtained. Thus you ſee when Conſcience is troubled after a right manner.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I am to direct, <hi>How troubled and afflicted Conſciences are to be Comforted.</hi> And before I begin, I have need to cry out, <hi>The Lord give me the Tongue of the Learned, that I may know how to ſpeak a word in Seaſon to him that is weary!</hi> Iſa. 50. 4. O you Afflicted Souls, that are toſſed in a Tempeſt! your Affliction is of all the deepeſt, the Tempeſt that you are in does beat moſt hard upon you. You have not to deal with an Arm of Fleſh, nor onely with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Darkneſs, but the Lord himſelf has bruiſed you. Now, for your Relief, I am to bring forth the ſweeteſt Comforts of the Goſpel; I am to Preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt: I am to tell you of Love that has Height, and Length, and Depth, and Breadth, and paſſes Knowledge. I am to diſplay the Mercy of God, which is great towards humbled ſinners as the Heaven is high above the Earth. But more particularly, I would lay theſe following things before you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This trouble of Conſcience that you are under, is really the work of the Spirit, the Comforter.</hi> Even under Conviction, and while in diſtreſs of Soul, you are really in a Comforters hand. There is a great deal
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44406:122"/> of difference between the wounds of an Enemy and the lancings of a Chirurgeon; the latter are the better born, becauſe in order unto a perfect Cure, and Eaſe, and Health. Three things are here to be Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe <hi>Convictions of the Spirit are a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> The Children of Men would all of them lye ſtill, and at laſt die in their wickedneſs, if the Spirit did not awaken ſome of them. 'Tis a kindneſs to be told of our danger while 'tis poſſible to get out of it. You groan and complain becauſe of your Guilt; you fear the wrath of God, and deſire his loving kindneſs. I may ſay truly, you are highly favoured, for how many round about you fearleſly provoke the dreadful God to his Face, and turn to their wicked courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the Battel. Now ſin is a burthen, your condition is much better than when you made light of it, and ſaw no harm like to follow upon it. 'Tis good for us to ſee the avenger of blood purſuing us, as long as the City of Refuge is open to receive and ſhelter us from that avenger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe convictions <hi>are in order unto Conſolation.</hi> Comfort is that which is proper and ſuitable to the Mourners; and reſt unto the weary and heavy laden. To go by Hell gates to Heaven is not to go at all out of the way. The Lord does bring Souls within the Suburbs of Hell ſometimes, that they may be the more afraid of ſin all their dayes, that they may value peace of Conſcience at an higher rate, and adore the Grace of God in catching them as fire brands out of the burning; <hi>Jonah cryed unto the Lord out of the Belly of Hell, and when his Soul fainted within him,</hi> Chap. 2. 3, 7. And ſurely his being heard and helped
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44406:123"/> did the more affect him. Oh, do not think much to Sow in Tears, as long as the promiſe is, you ſhall Reap in Joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may marvellouſly ſupport you under your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>that you do Judge and Condemn your ſelves.</hi> The Apoſtle expreſly ſays, that ſuch <hi>ſhall not be Judged,</hi> that is, condemned with the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. They that accuſe themſelves, invalidate Satans accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them; and they that condemn themſelves go the way to prevent Gods condemning them. He will not throw into Hell thoſe who are continually ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing themſelves thither, and ſee no poſſibility of Help but in Rich and Free Grace; and who, as they Judge themſelves for paſt ſins, are deſirous alſo for the future to be kept from Offending.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Relief of a troubled Conſcience, take Notice of <hi>the love of God towards the World, in ſending Chriſt into it. God ſo loved the World, that he gave his onely Begotten Son, that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh,</hi> John 3. 16. See alſo 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> This Love of God towards the World is Matter of great Encouragement if it be rightly improved: It ſhews how great a kindneſs God has for Mankind; He has contrived a way for their Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he has provided a Mediator for them, which he did not do for the Angels that fell from him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>He took not on him the Nature of Angels,</hi> or he took not hold on the Angels, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but he took on him the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whatever Chriſt did for Mans Salvation, 'twas the will of God he ſhould do it. The whole work of Redemption is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44406:123"/> a doing of the will of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. Sacrifices and Offerings being inſufficient to take away ſin: <hi>Then ſaid I, lo, I come; in the Volume of thy Book it is written of me to do thy Will, O God.</hi> Nay, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſaid to Love Chriſt upon this Account; partly, becauſe he laid down his Life to ſave Men from Eternal Death, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Becauſe I lay down my Life, therefore doth my Father Love me.</hi> Now, you know Chriſt's Life was given, that it might be a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for many.</p>
            <p>All this ſhews the good will of God towards Man, and how ready he is that Man ſhould be brought near unto him, and enjoy him, and be eternally happy in that enjoyment. This <hi>Amor Benevolentiae,</hi> this Love of good will in God, and deſire after Man's welfare, was taken notice of by the Angels, and they are brought in Admiring and Magnifying the Lord, when Chriſt a Saviour was Born into the VVorld, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>Suddenly there was a Multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt Praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, on Earth Peace, Good will towards Men.</hi> Let all this encourage drooping Spirits, and baniſh thoſe thoughts of God which Satan is apt to inject, and which are utterly unworthy of his Love and kindneſs towards Man.</p>

Becauſe he is God, therefore his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs being imputed unto ſinners is ſufficient for their Juſtification, though they have none of their own that is worth naming. The Apoſtle Magnifies the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, becauſe <hi>therein</hi> the Righteouſneſs of God <hi>is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Fairh to Faith,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. 'Tis called the Righteouſneſs of God, not onely becauſe God the Father does accept of it as perfect and ſufficient, but becauſe 'tis the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, who is truly God as well as Man, and from whoſe Deity is derived ſuch a value and vertue unto his Sufferings and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Surely the more we view the God-head of our Lord Jeſus, the firmer will be our recumbence upon him, and the leſs ſhall we be afraid of the Enemies of our Salvation, ſince he can ſo eaſily ſubdue them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Manhood of Chriſt,</hi> as well as his Godhead muſt be eyed. How often in the Goſpel is he called the Son of man, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt. The Son of man muſt be lifted up that he might draw all men to him,</hi> John 12: 32, 34. The Apoſtle tells us
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44406:125"/> 
               <hi>there is but one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. By taking our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him he is become neer a kin to us, and is not aſhamed to call us Brethren, Heb. 2. 11, 12. <hi>Both he that ſanctifieth and they that are ſanctified are all of one.</hi> Chriſt who ſanctifieth, hath the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature with Beleivers who are ſanctified, <hi>for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren,</hi> ſaying <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren, in the midſt of the Church will I ſing praiſe unto thee.</hi> With what boldneſs may the Children of men come to the Lord Jeſus, <hi>who was in all things made like them, that he might be a Merciful and Faithful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. <hi>Ruth</hi> emboldned her ſelf to ſpeak unto <hi>Boaz, Spread thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a neer kinſman,</hi> Ruth. 3. 9. Our Lord Jeſus is neer a kin to us, it belongs to him to redeem both us and our loſt Inheritance; we may with confidence deſire him to ſpread his skirt over us, and to betroth us unto himſelf for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the comforting of a troubled Conſcience, <hi>take notice of that compleat ſatisfaction that Chriſt has made unto Divine Juſtice, by offering up of himſelf upon the croſſe for ſin.</hi> Behold the Lamb of God ſlain, and taking away the ſin of the world. Three things are much to be ſtudied by thoſe that are wounded in their ſpirits. Chriſts ſuffering of Death his overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death; and his ſeconding his ſufferings with his perpetual interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His ſuffering of Death.</hi> The Apoſtle takes much notice of the perſon who died, he was altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; he died indeed for the unjuſt, but himſelf
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44406:125"/> was juſt and righteous. The penitent Thief ſpake Truth upon the Croſſe, when he rebuked his fellow, ſaying, <hi>Doſt not thou fear God ſeeing thou art in ſame condemnation, and we indeed juſtly, for we receive the reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,</hi> Luk. 23. 40, 41. Therefore he is likened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> He was made ſin indeed, and a Curſe for us; but he had no ſin of his own, whereby the leaſt Curſe or Puniſhment could be deſerved. Chriſt was innocent; and Oh! how high and great a Perſon was he? <hi>He being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal with God, yet humbled himſelf in the form of a Servant, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of Croſſe.</hi> Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8. And ſince he that was the Mighty God did thus humble and abaſe himſelf, there is no ſin ſo great but his humiliation may make ſatisfaction for it.</p>
            <p>I do not wonder that the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo highly concerning <hi>the knowledge of Chriſt Crucified.</hi> Here is the ground of mans Comfort and Salvation. When I behold the Son of God who has the ſame Eſſence, Power, Glory, and Eternity with the Father, ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo low as to become Man: when I behold him not only a Man, but a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief all his days; and read that at laſt he was wounded and bruiſed, and ſlain for ſin, I may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that here is enough ſuffered to ſatisfie the juſtice of God to the full. Sin indeed did riſe high becauſe committed againſt God, and it has been heightned by many agrravations; but the Son of God, did ſtoop low when he became Man, and ſtill was more and more abaſed till he came to the loweſt degree of his humiliation; beſides his ſufferings were aggravated,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44406:126"/> for he <hi>knew before hand all that was to come upon him,</hi> John 18. 4. He knew all the bitter ingredients and dregs of wrath that were in that Cup which he was to drink off to the very bottom; and in the midſt of his ſufferings his Father hides his face which made them ſo much the greater. Oh who can conceive the weight that lay upon our Lord, when all the iniquities of his whole Church lay upon him at once, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all deſerted, did roar out <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it be inquired, what the end of Chriſt was in his ſuffering of Death? the anſwer muſt be, 'twas, that he might put away ſin, his Blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſin, and to deliver us from that wrath which by ſin was merited. Oh ſweet Scripture, Rom. 5. 8. <hi>But God commendeth his love towards us in that whilſt we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us, much more then being now juſtified by his Blood we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> Our Lord was delivered for our offences; he was ſtricken for our iniquities, and 'tis evident that he did undergo to the full whatever was required, and paid the uttermoſt farthing of our debt, for he cryed out upon the croſſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and then gave up the Ghoſt, Joh. 19. 30.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The troubled Conſcience ſhould not only take notice of Chriſts ſuffering Death, but alſo <hi>of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Death in his Reſurrection.</hi> The Apoſtle in his triumph of Faith, ſpeaks of the Elect being ſecured from the charge of ſin by the Death of Chriſt, but <hi>rather</hi> by his Reſurrection, Rom. 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died; yea, rather that is riſen again.</hi> If he had been ſtill
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44406:126"/> in the grave all our hopes would have been buried with him. <hi>If Chriſt be not rais'd your Faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 17. He was for our debt arreſted as it were, and thrown into the grave, and being come out again we may conclude, that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice has no more to demand, and as our Surety he has no more to pay. <hi>Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him, Rom.</hi> 6. 9. His Reſurrection ſhews that his dying <hi>once</hi> was ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt <hi>ſeconds his ſufferings with continual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi> 
               <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Porrò hanc interceſſionem carnali ſenſu ne metiamur; non enim cogitandus est ſupplex flexis genibus, manibus expanſis Patrem deprecari: ſed quia apparet ipſe aſſiduè cum morte &amp; reſurrectione ſuâ, quae vice ſunt aeternae interceſſionis, &amp; vivae orationis efficaciam habent ut Patrem nobis concilient atque exorabilem reddant, merito dicitur intercedere.</hi> Calvin. <hi>in Epiſt. ad Rom.</hi> c. 8.</note> When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on High, and he ever lives to make interceſſion for us. 'Tis lookt upon as a great matter to have a friend in Court, that may ſpeak a good word for us to an earthly King, but how much more a priviledge is it to have ſuch a friend as the Lord Jeſus is, in the Court of Heaven, ready to back our Prayers with his own interceſſion, which is ever prevalent? but troubled Souls may fear that Chriſt prays not for them, ſince he ſays, <hi>I pray for theſe, I pray not for the World, but for thoſe which thou haſt given me, for they are thine, John</hi> 17. 9. To this I reply; that Chriſt prays for all that believe in him, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for all them that ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi> Now thoſe troubled
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44406:127"/> Souls that have no confidence in the Fleſh, but are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel, theſe are to be counted among Beleivers in him, and therefore may be encouraged by his interceſſion. Nay the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly, that <hi>He made interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Tranſgreſſours,</hi> Iſa 53. 12. That was one of his petitions upon the Croſſe, <hi>Father forgive them for they know not what they do,</hi> Luk. 23, 34. and theſe Tranſgreſſours for whom Chriſt interceded, 'tis very likely were thoſe who were charged with murthering of Chriſt, and were prickt in their Hearts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and brought unto true Repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For the comforting of an afflicted and troubled Conſcience obſerve, how plainly the Goſpel does affirm <hi>that Chriſt is both able and willing to ſave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis very evident that <hi>Chriſt is able to ſave,</hi> no guilt ſo great as to exceed the merit of his Blood, his Blood cleanſeth from <hi>all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. and that though it be of never ſo deep a dye, Iſa. 1. 18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet they ſhall be white as Snow though they be red like crimſon they ſhall be as wool.</hi> No ſpiritual malady is <hi>hujus medici opprobrium,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this Phyſician. What cures has he wrought, what ſins has he pardon'd! How many that were once heinous tranſgreſſors on Earth before their Converſion, yet notwithſtanding were reconciled and regenerated by his Blood and Spirit, and are now triumphing with him in his Kingdom! Oh you troubled Souls! be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged that help is laid upon one that is Mighty, <hi>that is able to ſave unto the uttermoſt, thoſe that come unto God by him, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. The belief that Chriſt <hi>can</hi> help will you have an influence upon you. The Leper came to Chriſt upon a perſwaſion that Chriſt <hi>could</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:44406:127"/> make him clean, though he had no aſſurance that Chriſt would do it. <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> ſays the Leper; Chriſt preſently anſwers, <hi>I will be thou clean, and immediately his Leproſie was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> Mat. 8. 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis very evident alſo that Chriſt <hi>is willing to ſave,</hi> becauſe this is moſt doubted of by troubled Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, I ſhall prove it by theſe arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He declares himſelf <hi>willing to ſave the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> if they would but conſent to their own Salvation. Rom. 10. ult. <hi>All the day long have I ſtretched forth my hand to a ſtiff-necked and gain-ſaying people.</hi> He ſtretched forth his hand as proffering pardon and life to them, and as being ready to receive them if they had been minded to return. He tells the obſtinate inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he would often have gathered them, but they would not be gathered, Mat. 23. 37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together as an hen gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not:</hi> and if he be willing to gather the obſtinate, ſurely the penitent he will not refuſe; thoſe that deſire and are willing to fly under his wings for ſhelter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He promiſes that he <hi>will give reſt to the heavy laden;</hi> that he will <hi>in no wiſe caſt out</hi> any that come to him. Heark how general the invitation is, <hi>Ho eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that thirſteth come to the waters;</hi> and theſe waters of life may be had without mony and without price, Iſa. 55. 1. They that <hi>labour,</hi> they that are <hi>heavy laden,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> that labour and are heavy laden, are called to come to Chriſt, and he aſſures them they ſhall find reſt to their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44406:128"/> Souls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29. One ſaid, <note n="(q)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mallemus carere ſole, coelo, terrâ, omnibus Elementis,</hi> &amp;c. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neccerus, <hi>in Paedag. Chriſtian.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>We had better want the Sun, the Heavens, the Earth, and all the Elements; yea, and Life it ſelf, than that one ſweet Sentence of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> Come unto me all ye that Labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt <hi>was ſent by his Father, and did come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this very end, that he might ſave.</hi> 'Tis certain the Father ſent him to ſave, and that both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 6. <hi>And he ſaid, 'tis a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my Servant to raiſe up the Tribes of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to reſtore the preſerved of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>I will alſo give thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> Surely our Lord is willing to do that which his Father ſent him on purpoſe that he might do. He himſelf came to this end, that he might ſave; nay, he ſeeks as well as ſaves, which ſhews his willingneſs to ſave indeed. When the Shepherd ſeeks after the loſt Sheep, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him willing to find it, and to bring it home to the Fold: And when the Woman ſeeks after the loſt piece of Silver, we conclude ſhe is willing to get it again. And Chriſt ſeeking after Sinners, and following them with his Meſſengers and Word, and his Spirit which ſtrives with them; certainly he is very willing that thoſe who are dead ſhould be made alive, and who are loſt ſhould be found, and made partakers of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>All fulneſs dwells in Chriſt on purpoſe that he may impart of it.</hi> He charges them that are Rich in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44406:128"/> this World to be ready to Diſtribute, and willing to Communicate; and can you think that he is a Niggard of his own Riches? He counſelled even luke-warm <hi>Laodicea to come to him for Goldtryed in the Fire, that ſhe might be Rich</hi> indeed, as before ſhe was in her own Opinion. He is ready to ſatiate the weary, and to repeniſh every ſorrowful Soul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis for his Fathers Honour and his own Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction when any are ſaved.</hi> Therefore Chriſt is moſt willing to ſave. God is Honoured hereby; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives us plainly to underſtand that when any obtain Redemption, and forgiveneſs, and are accepted in the Beloved, <hi>This is to the praiſe of the Glory of the Grace of God,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. So <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his Glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis an Excellent paſſage of <hi>Luther,</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Et ſi ego indignus qui eripiar &amp; ſalver, Tu tamen dignus qui lauderis, glorificeris, ameris in ſaecula; At laudari non poteris, nec miſerecordia glorificatur, niſi ſint quos eripias à morte &amp; ſalves ab inferno.</hi> Luther. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. 76. <hi>a.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Though I, Lord, am unwortthy to be delivered and ſaved, yet thou art worthy to be praiſed, and Glorified, and loved for ever; but thus praiſed thou wilt not be, nor thy Mercy Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleſs there are ſome whom thou doſt ſave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.</hi> 'Tis alſo for the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to ſave, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and be ſatisfied.</hi> When a Woman is in ſtrong pain, who can in Reaſon queſtion her willingneſs to be delivered? Surely ſhe is deſirous to ſee of the Travel of her Body, and how joyful is ſhe when a Child is Born into the VVorld? The new Birth, and the Salvation of ſinners, is the Fruit of the Travel of Chriſt's ſoul; ſurely he is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44406:129"/> willing to ſee this Fruit. Away, away with unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doubts! He is willing to ſave, be you but willing to be ſaved, and you ſhall in no wiſe miſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For the Relieving of a troubled Conſcience, <hi>take Notice of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe Office is to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> John 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. There is great care taken by our Lord, not onely that his Church may be ſafe, but alſo that ſhe may have Peace and Joy, and Comfort, even in this Vail of tears. Theſe are ſome of the words which he ſpeaks: <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you; I will not leave you comfortleſs, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,</hi> John 14. 18. 27. and John 15. 11. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that my Joy might remain in you, and that you Joy may be full.</hi> The Prophets of the Lord are Commanded to ſpeak Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 1, 2. <hi>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, ſaith your God, ſpeak ye comfortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and cry unto her that her warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and her Iniquity is Pardoned.</hi> And 'tis the work of the Spirit Powerfully to apply and ſet home theſe Comfortable words, that they may be effectual unto Conſolation. Let humbled Souls Obſerve theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God, who is a Comforter, <hi>is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto all that ask him.</hi> Some of you know what that Natural Affection is which Parents bear to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Affections deſcend, Parents love their Children ordinarily better than Children do their Parents. Now, with what readineſs, with how good a will do Earthly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44406:129"/> Parents give Bread unto their hungry Children; and Chriſt expreſly ſays, that with <hi>much more</hi> readineſs <hi>will our Heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit unto them that ask him,</hi> Luke 11. 13. This Scripture does give ſufficient warrant unto any breathing to go unto God for his Spirit to enlighten, to convince, to renew and change, and at laſt to comfort them with as much confidence, as Children go for Neceſſaries unto the moſt tender Earthly Fathers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe conſolations of the Spirit eſpecially belong <hi>unto thoſe who are troubled as you are.</hi> The broken Veſſel is fit for the Oyl of Joy and Gladneſs to be poured into it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath Annointed me to Preach good tidings to the Meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to Proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound, to Proclaim the Acceptable Year of the Lord, to Comfort all that mourn.</hi> The Spirit does delight to comfort them that are caſt down, for theſe will not take up with other Comforts, they prize the Spirits Conſolations, they cry Grace, Grace, when they receive them, and walk humbly and warily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being afraid to loſe ſuch precious things by freſh Trangreſſions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For the Comforting of a troubled Conſcience, <hi>Behold and Wonder at Gods condeſcention, in that he does intreat ſinners to be Reconciled,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be Reconciled unto God.</hi> You cannot imagine that He who has been ſo bitterly provoked by you ſhould be ſo ready to forgive you, and ſo willing to be Friends
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44406:130"/> with you; but you would do well to obſerve, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord had promiſed Mercy and abundant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to ſinners willing to forſake their evil ways and thoughts, he preſently adds, that his Mercy ſhall be extended to them, though they were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord.</hi> That is, you muſt not meaſure my Mercy by yours, nor think that I am able and willing to put up and forgive no more than you. You are eaſily provoked, but I am ſlow to Anger; you are hardly Reconciled, but I am ready to forgive. I am willing to remit the greateſt wrongs, and to receive the wrong-doers into favour, if they do but ſincerely return to me, and are willing for the future to pleaſe and ſerve me. <hi>As the Heavens are high above the Earth, ſo are my ways</hi> of Kindneſs and Compaſſion, <hi>higher than your ways; and my thoughts than your thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 55. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>When there is a difference between any, the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior commonly intreats the Superiour to be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; but here the Lord, who is infinitely above us, intreats Us to be Friends, that are infinitely below him. He that does the wrong commonly intreats him whom he has wronged; but here the Lord, who has been Injured and Affronted, and Offended, and can moſt eaſily be Revenged, does intreat them that have done the Injury. He that is at the Mercy of another, commonly intreats him at whoſe Mercy he lies; but here the Lord, who has abſolute Power to do what he will with Offenders, and can Glorifie himſelf in their Eternal Deſtruction, does intreat them to be at Peace, and to Repent, that they may be ſaved. Finally, he that is the depending Perſon commonly does intreat him upon whom he has ſuch dependance: but here the Lord, who has no dependance at all upon ſinners, nor
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44406:130"/> any need at all of them, does yet intreat them to come to him, who have ſuch intire dependance upon him, that they cannot live or move or be without him, and cannot be happy but in the enjoyment of him. Oh what manner of Grace and Kindneſs is this! and how may drooping ſpirits be revived, and encouraged to hope in ſuch a God: read the parable of the prodigal &amp; ſee him by neceſſity driven home to his Fathers houſe, behold his Father running to him, embracing him though he had ſpent all among Harlots and in Riotous living, and then give a gheſſe how much more willing the Lord is to receive returning ſinners.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For the right comforting of a troubled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Study well the Covenant of Grace.</hi> The Covenant of works is not to be laid hold upon by any of the fallen Children of <hi>Adam;</hi> this promiſes life indeed but 'tis upon condition of perfect and perpetual conformity both of Heart and Life unto the Law of God. But the Covenant of Grace is vaſtly different from that firſt Covenant. Sinners may lay hold on this new Covenant, and they cannot pleaſe the Lord better than by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore <hi>chuſing the things that pleaſe him, &amp; talking hold on his Covenant</hi> are join'd together, Iſa. 56. 4. If ſinners being convinced of their loſt eſtate by their iniquities, are willing to receive Chriſt to be their Prince and Saviour, and to turn and give themſelves to God; he has ingaged in this Covenant to be their God and Father, to give them Grace and at laſt Glory and in the mean while to withhold no good thing from them. In this Covenant of Grace obſerve theſe four things, all which may be helpful unto your Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Covenant is <hi>well ordered,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. <hi>He hath made with me an Everlaſting Covenant orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:44406:131"/>

They have no righteouſneſs or works of their own that they may reſt upon: but here is a perfect Righteouſneſs provided, even the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt made theirs? as their ſins were made his by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks plainly of the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of the man to whom the Lord imputeth Righteouſneſs without works,</hi> Rom. 4. 6. and 2 Cor. 5. ult. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> As they have no Righteouſneſs, ſo they are ſick of Spiritual Plagues, but in this Covenant God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to cure them, Iſa. 57. 18. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes and will heal him, I will lead him alſo and reſtore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto him and his mourners.</hi> They need cleanſing becauſe of their manifold defilements. But God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>that he will ſprinkle clean water upon them and make them clean, and from all their filthineſs, and from all their Idols he will cleanſe them.</hi> They are weak and unable to do their duty, and perſevere in wel-doing, but God promiſes to <hi>renew their ſtrength, ſo that they ſhall run and not be weary, and walk and not faint,</hi> Iſa. 40. ult.</p>

               <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew to the Heirs of Promiſe the immutability of his Counſel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an Oath, that by two immutable things, wherein it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us.</hi> When God ſwears in his wrath, it may make obſtinate ſinners to Tremble; but when he ſwears in his Love, it may cauſe humble ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Rejoyce. And not only the Oath of God but the Death of Chriſt the Teſtator makes this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſure. A Teſtament though alterable while men are living, yet 'tis of force when they are dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. Our Lord Jeſus the Teſtator has undergone Death and has bequeathed unto all broken-hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that come to him and are willing to be wholly His; Pardon, and Grace, and Peace, and Glory; and therefore all this ſhall be ſurely given them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Covenant is <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> the things therein promiſed are durable, and that love which humble and believing Souls have an intereſt in, is unchangeable. The Covenant ſhall never fail on Gods part, Iſa. 54. 10. <hi>The Mountains ſhall depart and the Hills be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, nor the Covenant of my Peace be removed, ſaith the Lord, that hath Mercy upon thee.</hi> And he has engaged it ſhall not fail on the part of his People, Jer. 32. 40. <hi>I will make with them an Everlaſting Covenant that I will not turn away from them to do them good</hi> (but how Lord if they fall back and deal treacherouſly?) No, ſayes he, <hi>I will put my Fear into their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Promiſes of this New Covenant <hi>are made good for the Lords own ſake, not for ours,</hi> well may
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44406:132"/> it be called a Covenant of Grace, for whatſoever is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by vertue of it is beſtowed freely. Let free Grace be well ſtudied, and all objections from unworthineſſe will fall to the ground: God never pardon'd any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did Deſerve a pardon, but all that he has pardon'd, had they been dealt with according to their ſins had been condemned everlaſtingly. O you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Conſciences hark how the Lord ſpeaks, Iſa. 43. 24. 25. <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wearied me with thy iniquities,</hi> One would have thought that hereupon God ſhould have ſaid, I will now make thee to groan under my wrath, and my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried patience ſhall be turned into fiery indignation. Oh no the Lord inſtead of breathing forth anger, abounds with Kindneſs, <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> And as for his own ſake he promiſes to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the guilty, ſo alſo to cleanſe and renew the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, I will put within you my own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he ſhall cauſe you to walk in my Statutes: I will ſave you from all your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſes,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27, 28, And then it follows v. 32. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known to you, be aſhamed and confounded for your own wayes, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p n="9">9. For the relieving of a troubled Conſcience, <hi>heed thoſe encouragements and aſſurances which are given unto ſuch as deſire after Grace and Holineſs.</hi> Chriſt pronounces <hi>them bleſſed that Hunger and Thirſt,</hi> that is, which deſire earneſtly <hi>after Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 5. 6.

               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:44406:132"/> 
               <hi>is before God, and their groaning is not hid from him.</hi> I told you before, that a lazy wiſh after Grace ſignifies nothing where there is ſtronger deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, and that deſire keeps a man under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ſin and hinders his turning unto God. But this is certainly true, <hi>that a true deſire after Grace, does argue Truth of Grace.</hi> If you ask me how true deſires after Grace may be known, I ſhall anſwer in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. True deſires after ſpiritual things are <hi>grounded upon Judgement and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. Davids</hi> mind was enlightned to ſee the goodneſs, al ſufficiency, and glory of God, and therefore he cryes out <hi>my Soul Thirſteth for God, for the living God, Pſal.</hi> 42. 2. <hi>Through the precepts of the Lord he got underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and perceived the Evil of ſin, and upon this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Hatred of it, which does include a deſire to have it totally ſubdued.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True deſires after ſpiritual things <hi>are not to be diverted,</hi> but do prevail whatever is caſt in the way. Let the World and the God of it make never ſo big of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, all is undervalued in compariſon of the favour of God, and fellowſhip with him, Pſal. 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> All things elſe are counted loſſe, and dung compared with the Lord Jeſus, and the Pearle of price.</p>
            <p n="3">3. True deſires <hi>are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, after All kind of Grace.</hi> Strength againſt every Corruption is longed for, and 'tis lookt upon as a bleſſed thing to be filled with all the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which are by
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44406:133"/> Jeſus Chriſt unto the Glory and Praiſe of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. True deſires <hi>put Souls upon earneſt ſeeking.</hi> There will be frequency and fervency in Prayer, a ſerious attendance upon God in his Ordinances, pains will not be grudged, that are taken for the ſecuring of a Soul, for the obtaining ſuch excellent things as the Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſſe of God, the Grace of his Spirit, and a Kingdom that cannot be moved. <hi>One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Lord that will I ſeek after,</hi> Pſal. 27. 4. I might alſo add that theſe deſires <hi>are permanent,</hi> not pangs that ſoon wear off; but they do abide: there is alſo grief and pain, becauſe there is ſo little of that which is deſired, ſo little life and ſoftneſs of heart, and purity; and though never ſo much is given, yet they are unſatiable here on Earth. Theſe deſires will be fully ſatisfied with no leſſe than the ſeeing of God face to face above, Pſal. 17. 15. <hi>As for me I will behold thy Face in Righteouſneſſe, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi>

He is a God <hi>Merciful,</hi> this may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us when ſenſible of our miſery; he is <hi>Gracious,</hi> this may encourage us againſt our vileneſſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs; he is <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> this may keep us from ſinking into deſpair though 'twas long before we thought of turning to him: He is <hi>abundant in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth,</hi> though we are never ſo empty here is enough to fill us: He <hi>keeps Mercy for thouſands,</hi> his Treaſures are not exhauſted by former ages, we may go to him and be enriched, <hi>he forgives iniquity tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> Let none then ſay <hi>there is no Hope,</hi> of what ſorts or ſizes ſoever their ſins be.</p>
            <p>But here let me Caution again, that no ſin be ſecretly cheriſhed, for if the cauſe of trouble remain, how can Conſcience be truly Comforted? In good earneſt ſet upon the Mortification of all the Members of the Body of ſin, but eſpecially pluck out the right Eye, and cut off the right Hand.

               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Some do cry out, that <hi>their ſins are,</hi> primae Magnitudinis, <hi>of the firſt Magnitude;</hi> that guilt which they have contracted is ſo vaſt, and themſelves are ſo inexcuſable in their wickedneſs, that they cannot let it once enter into their thoughts, that ever God ſhould pardon or ſave ſuch provoking wretches and rebels as They have been. They call to remembrance what they have been, and what they have done; their Iniquities which they have committed have been of a very hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Nature; and as to their Number, what was ſaid concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, may very well be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here; they have been ſo many as the Stars of the Sky in multitude, and as the Sand which is by the Sea-ſhore innumerable.

The meaſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44406:135"/> broader than the Sea: But yet as great as 'tis, it does not give the leaſt encouragement to preſumption, but againſt deſpair and deſpondency it may be a mighty Antidote.

            <p>That is a notable promiſe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 19. having ſaid, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning Iniquity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in Mercy?</hi> it follows, <hi>thou wilt caſt all their ſin into the depth of the Sea.</hi> In the deepeſt part of the Sea, the greateſt Mountains, if they could be caſt in, would be ſwallowed up as well as Mole-hills. Divine Mercy is ſuch a depth, it can cover the greateſt ſins as well as the ſmalleſt; and being once caſt into this depth, they ſhall never riſe again unto the ſinners Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any more than things caſt into the deepeſt part of the Ocean can ever be fetched up again.</p>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44406:136"/> things elſe you find a kind of ſtupidneſs, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs even about your worldly matters alſo: you muſt not from diſtemper of Body conclude the judicial hardning of your Hearts.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe in Scripture which were judicially hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>never complained of their hardneſs,</hi> but this is your complaint and burthen. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were both hardned in a way of judgment, but though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſenſible of other Plagues, yet not at all of this which was incomparably the worſt of all the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> he cries out, pray to the Lord to take away the Locuſts, the Frogs, the Thunder and Hail; but never, pray to the Lord to take away the Heart of Stone from him. And as for the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, they thought themſelves Righteous, and whole, and ſlighted a Phyſician and Saviour, for they thought they could do well enough without him.</p>
            <p>3. You are not <hi>altogether paſt feeling, becauſe you feel your own hardneſs,</hi> and 'tis a mercy that you know this Plague of your own heart. Oh go to the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who has promiſed to cure it, and to give an heart of Fleſh to you. This is Gods way and method to make ſinners ſenſible of their hardneſs, that he may ſoften them; of their blindneſs, that he may give them eye-Salve; of their filthineſs, that he may cleanſe them; of their guilt that he may pardon them; of their empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that he may fill them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. They under trouble of Spirit do further object, <hi>alas we are not able to come to Chriſt,</hi> though our Eternal Salvation does lye on't; our Conſciences are wounded but we cannot come for cure and eaſe.</p>
            <pb n="254" facs="tcp:44406:137"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Is this a ſmall matter, that God has <hi>made you ſenſible of your natural inability?</hi> how many do miſtake, and think they have a power to help themſelves, and this hinders them from ſeriouſly applying themſelves unto Him that alone is able to ſave. You ſee, and ſay, you have no might, 'tis well, a promiſe belongs to you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 29. <hi>He giveth Power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> i. e. To them that ſee they have no might, for all have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally none.</p>
            <p>2. Though you cannot come to Chriſt for Grace and Comfort, <hi>yet the Father can draw you;</hi> and have not you an Heart to cry to him to do this for you? What's your Language in ſecret Prayer? Is it not <hi>Draw me, and I will run after thee?</hi> Is it not <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned?</hi> Thus ſpake the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. Thus ſpake <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of Old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and both were heard; nay, the Lord ſays, I have <hi>ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim, ſurely your cryes for drawing and turning ſhall not be in vain.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay, you are not able to come to Chriſt; but are you <hi>willing</hi> to come to him? Yes, pray who has made you able to be thus willing, but onely that God <hi>who works to will of his own good Pleaſure?</hi> If you are willing to come, you are able to come; for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies in being willing. If you are willing to have the Son, you have him, and Life by him, <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non pedibus ſed affectu, non migrando ſed amando venitur ad Christum.</hi> Auguſtin.</note> for 'tis with your Wills that you receive him, and ſo have Power to become the Children of God. The Apoſtle
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44406:137"/> tells us; <hi>That with the Heart man believes unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. By the Heart, in Scripture, is commonly meant the Will; ſo that if the Will conſents to have Chriſt, as Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Redemption: Here is indeed that Faith which is Juſtifying and Saving. Chriſt having taken the Will, has taken the main Fort, that by Nature ſtands out againſt him, and Commands the whole Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Some under trouble of Conſcience cry out, <hi>They have been enlightned, and under Conviction heretofore; but ſince their Illumination and Convictions they have fallen away;</hi> and therefore now they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there is nothing remains, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and of fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>All back-ſliding, though groſſe, is not the unpardonable ſin. David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were both enlightned, both did fall, and that into groſs wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet both Repented, both were pardoned, and reſtored to favour, and both are now in Glory.</p>
            <p>2. Even <hi>Back-ſliders are called upon to return.</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had played the Harlots with many Lovers, they had ſpoken and done evil things as they could, and yet many times in one Chapter, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. they are called after to come home to God, from whom they had ſo deeply Revolted: though therefore you ought to mourn, and be in bitterneſs for your Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and unſtedfaſtneſs, yet you muſt not mourn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope.</p>
            <pb n="258" facs="tcp:44406:138"/>
            <p> 3. Promiſes are made to Back-ſliders, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>of Mercy and Healing,</hi> Jer. 3. 12. <hi>Go and Proclaim theſe words towards the North, and ſay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, thou back-ſliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine Anger to fall upon you, for I am Merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep Anger for ever.</hi> And v. 22. again he ſays, <hi>Return ye back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Children, and I will heal your back-ſlidings.</hi> O you poor ſinners, that are troubled for your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, catch hold of theſe words, as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Servants did of the words of the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 6. After all, ſome may ſay, Though we cannot deny that we are willing to part with every ſin, and to have our Hearts cleanſed; though we deſire God to be our Father and Portion, and Chriſt to be our Prince, and Head, and Saviour, and Husband; yet we are afraid our Hearts are not right, becauſe all this may <hi>be meerly for fear of Hell,</hi> and becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we do all this, 'tis impoſſible that Hell ſhould be eſcaped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>You ought to be afraid of Hell:</hi> Why is ſuch a dreadful place ſpoken of, but that the Sons of Men might dread the coming thither? Our Lord Exhorts his Diſciples to fear God upon this very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>that he was able to deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell,</hi> Luke 12. 5. Mat. 10. 28.</p>
            <p>2. A fear of Hell never, that we read of, carried Reprobates very far, or ſurely not ſo far as to make them willing to caſt away every ſin, and to accept of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44406:138"/> whole Chriſt, and to give up themſelves, Bodies, Souls, Health, Strength, Time, all to him, as appears in <hi>Felix, Agrippa, Herod,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>3. If you deſire Cleanſing and Sanctification, 'tis a ſign that ſin it ſelf is a burthen to you, as well as the Puniſhment of it feared by you: If this might be otherwiſe avoided, could you be contented to be ſlaves to ſin ſtill?</p>
            <p>4. I grant, it may be ſaid concerning prizing of Chriſt, chuſing of God, and endeavouring to pleaſe him in all things; that you muſt go to Hell if you don't do all this. But where does the Scripture ſay, that though you do all this, you may go to Hell after all? 'Tis true, unleſs you are ſincere, you muſt go to Hell; but it does not follow, that though you are ſincere, you may go to Hell notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>5. Do not you look upon the Lord as all-ſufficient? as the chiefeſt good? Do not you ſee an emptineſs in all the Creatures, and the evil that is in ſin? Is not ſin hated, the Creature ſcorned in compariſon of this God? If ſo, 'tis a ſign that the goodneſs of God does take you, and affect your Hearts, as well as the fear of Hell affright you.</p>
            <p>6. If there be a will to be Sanctified throughout, and to be turned with your whole Heart unto God; this is not the product of ſlaviſh Fear of Hell, <hi>but is really the work of the Lords Spirit.</hi> 'Tis he that works <hi>both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil 2. The moſt ſtartling Truths, and aſtoniſhing conſiderations would never be able <hi>of themſelves</hi> to make you willing to divorce your Luſts, and to accept of Chriſt upon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44406:139"/> Goſpel-terms If therefore you are brought unto this, that you prize the Lord Jeſus at ſo high a rate, as to conſent to part with every ſin for his ſake, and to follow the Lamb in what way ſoever it ſhall pleaſe him to lead you; you may warrantably conclude, That the Spirit has been at Work in you, and having <hi>begun a good work in you,</hi> he will compleat it. And you may confidently ſay, with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 138. 8. <hi>The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me; thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O Lord, endureth for ever, forſake not the work of thine own hands.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> IV. Of Exhortation. Let it be <hi>the care of you all to have a good Conſcience.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text is ſet forth as a good Example for all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a very fair Copy for all to write after. It is Counſel ordinarily given to Tradeſmen, <hi>Keep your Shops, and your Shops will keep you.</hi> So I may ſay, <hi>Look well to your Conſciences, and your Conſciences will look well to you.</hi> If there be an Heaven upon Earth, 'tis a good Conſcience; if there be an Hell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, 'tis a bad Conſcience. I ſhall ſecond my Exhortation with theſe following Arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that has a good Conſcience can <hi>look upward to God with Confidence,</hi> 1 John 3. 21, 22. <hi>Beloved, if our Heart condemn us not, then have we confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> With what boldneſs may ſuch come to the Throne of Grace! For God is their Friend, nay, their Father, and how infinitely does he ſurpaſs all other Parents in Wiſdom, Affection, Tenderneſs, Sufficiency! and therefore expectation
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44406:139"/> may be raiſed to a great height of receiving much from him.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience ſees ſmiles in Gods Face: Fury is not in him, all his wrath is taken away, and <hi>his Countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> Pſal. 11. <hi>ult.</hi> God is in Covenant with theſe upright ones, and with Joy they may ſtudy the Attributes of God, and ſee how all are engaged for them. He is Wiſe for them, Good for them, Faithful for them, All-ſufficient for them; nay, his Juſtice, being ſatisfied by his Son, is for them too. He is Infinite, Eternal, and unchangeable, and all this makes for them; and how great is their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſuch a God is theirs! <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Meditation of God was ſweet;</hi> God was his Joy, <hi>nay, his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy.</hi> The Lord being his Portion, how does he exult in his ſpirit, ſaying, <hi>The lines are fallen to me in pleaſant places, yea, I have a very goodly Heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16. 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that has a good Conſcience can look <hi>inward with Satisfastion.</hi> The diſſatisfaction of a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is great, and moſt Afflicting; when a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to himſelf, and is tortured by himſelf, and his ſelf-reflecting thoughts prove as ſo many ſtings to pierce and pain him; what a caſe is that Man in? Theſe kind of Tribulations find a Man out, and there is no flying from them, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

His God and his Conſcience were ſuch a Feaſt, and Joy and Satisfaction to him, that he knew 'twas not in the Power of Earth or Hell to daunt or hurt him.</p>
            <p>Oh, what unutterable contentation is there in the Heart, that upon reflection and ſearch, finds it ſelf the Temple of the Spirit, the Habitation where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son do make their abode: That finds it ſelf <hi>Clothed with white Rayment,</hi> Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Enriched with that Gold tried in the Fire,</hi> Rev.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44406:140"/> 3. 18. made partaker of the Divine Nature, Adorned with the Image of God, filled with the Graces of the Spirit, and thereby ſees it fitting for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He that has a good Conſcience <hi>can look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſee himſelf ſecured.</hi> Never any one with a good Conſcience went to the place of Torment, but onely thoſe who refuſed to have a good Conſcience, or made ſhip-wrack of it. Though Hell be prepared for the Devil, yet he has not the Keys of that place, but they hang at Chriſt's Girdle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 18. <hi>I am he that Liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell, and of Death.</hi> And certainly, ſince Chriſt has the Keys of Hell, no Believers, whoſe Conſciences are truly good, ſhall be flung in thither, for theſe are the Members of his Body; and the Head loves his Members too well, to ſuffer them to be thrown into Everlaſting fire.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience by the eye of Faith looks down, and takes Notice of the Damned in their Miſery, ſees them groaning under the fierceneſs of the Almighty's wrath, ſees them fed upon by the VVorm that dies not, and tormented in that flame which ſhall never be extinguiſhed, and bound faſt in thoſe Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſhall never be unlooſed; and then rejoyces to ſee it ſelf ſafe under the wing of the Lord Jeſus; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in that Deliverance and Salvation from future wrath, whereof Chriſt is the Author.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that has a good Conſcience <hi>can look upon his outward comforts and take comfort in them.</hi> What he has is not a Snare to him, but attended with a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; upon this ſcore the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>a little that a Righteous man has is better than the Riches of many</hi>

               <hi>wicked, Pſal.</hi> 37. 16. A good Conſcience does in a great meaſure cure that vanity and vexation of Spirit that is in the Creature; for when theſe outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are given with the Divine Bleſſing then as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks <hi>no ſorrow is added with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The upright man does taſte the love of God in the Food he eats, and though it be but a dinner of Herbs, yet this love makes it better than a ſtalled Ox with the Lords Curſe and Hatred. He feels the love of God in the Clothes he wears and though of coarſer cloth, yet they are better than the Purple, and fine Linnen and coſtly array of that rich man, that received all his good things in this preſent world, and after was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Hell poor and naked. All the gifts he receive are indeed bleſſings to one that's Righteous, for he has the Giver with them, and is brought ſtill nearer unto the Giver by them.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p> But a good Conſcience is deaf unto the Devil, and ſcorns his offers, for his offers are to the loſſe of the Righteous man. What are the riches of the World which Satan talks ſo much of, compared with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches of Chriſt? what are the pleaſures of ſin, compared with peace of Conſcience? what are all Earthly advantages and preferments compared with Communion with God, and the Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance?</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience is firmly perſwaded <hi>that 'tis good for us to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal, 73. ult. to be near to Him is for our Honour, Intereſt, Safety, Delight and ſatisfaction, and hereupon the Believer rejects Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan with an Holy contempt and indignation; for he ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There is profit in it, <hi>to dye is gain</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, he gains more grace in the inſtant of his diſſolution, than he got all his dayes before; for upon death his Spirit is made perfect in Holineſs. There is pleaſure in death, for ſometimes 'tis ſweetned with raviſhing tranſports of

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> IV. <hi>Of Advice unto them whoſe Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are good,</hi> which have been cleanſed and quieted by the blood of Chriſt, and by the VVord and Spirit of Grace. My Advice is in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be very <hi>thankfull for this unſpeakable Gift of a good Conſcience.</hi> The largeſt Empire in the VVorld, a Crown of pure Gold upon the Head, is nothing near ſo great a Bleſſing as a pure and peaceable Conſcience. I may uſe the Angels Salutation to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> unto every Saint that has ſuch a Conſcience. <hi>Hail, thou that art highly Favoured! The Lord is with thee, Bleſſed art thou among the Sons of Men.</hi> 'Tis a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a great one, to have a good Name, to be in good Health, to have good Eyes, and other Senſes perfect; to have good Natural Parts, to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of the good things of this Life, to Live in good and Peaceable Days; but to have a good Conſcience, is better than any of theſe, nay, than all theſe put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. To excite you unto Thankfulneſs for a good Conſcience, think of three ſorts of Perſons: Of the Secure, of the Troubled, of the Damned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Think of <hi>the ſecure,</hi> what woful work are they employed about, they ſin boldly, and dare to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that love which they bear to their Fleſhly and Worldly Luſts: How? ſay they, muſt we part with theſe, if we will go to Heaven! Nay, we will keep them, though we go to Hell along with them. Theſe ſecure ſinners <hi>are like one that lies down in the midſt of</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:44406:144"/> 
               <hi>the Sea, or as he that ſleeps upon the top of a Maſt:</hi> They are like unto <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Drunkard, <hi>they ſtrike themſelves, but ſay, they are not ſick; they beat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for the preſent feel it not,</hi> Prov. 23. 34, 35. And who is it that makes you to differ from the moſt Profane and ſtupid ſinner upon the Face of the Earth? Admire and Magnifie that diſtinguiſhing Grace and Love which has granted you a well-grounded Peace, when ſo many Thouſands onely cry Peace to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but are every moment in danger of Wrath and Hell, and everlaſting Trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think of <hi>the troubled in Spirit,</hi> to make you the more thankful for a good Conſcience. While your Souls are at eaſe in the Arms and Embraces of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; how many complain of broken Bones! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do make their Beds to ſwim, and water their Couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with their Tears! How many cry out, that Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are turned upon them, and purſue their Souls as the wind, and that when they call unto the Lord, he is ſo far from regarding, that with his ſtrong hand he does oppoſe himſelf againſt them, <hi>Job</hi> 30. 15. 20, 21. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate well upon the torture of a wounded Spirit, and then let all that is within you bleſs the Lord for Healing you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Think of <hi>the Damned,</hi> whoſe Conſciences are in a perpetual Rage, who are Racked with Deſpair, and whoſe Torment ſhall never end. They are Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the ſame Chains of Darkneſs with the Apoſtate Angels, and theſe Chains are Everlaſting. Ah, now their Wounds are incurable, becauſe their Phyſitian all their days was ſlighted, and their Wounds were made light of, and no Healing is to be at all expected. And you that are Saints, if Rich Grace had not taken
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44406:145"/> hold of you, would have been of the number of theſe miſerable Souls; if you had been dealt with according to your deſervings, you would have been weeping and wailing in outer Darkneſs that are now rejoycing in Hope of the Glory of God, ſurely ſuch differencing Kindneſs calls aloud for Praiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You that have a good Conſcience <hi>be Compaſſionate to them whoſe Conſciences are evil:</hi> They need your Pity, becauſe they have none to themſelves, and your pity may not be altogether unprofitable to them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for their evil ways with mildneſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and faithfulneſs; <hi>hate them not ſo much, as to ſuffer ſin to lie upon them,</hi> Lev. 19. 17. <hi>Cain</hi> indeed did ſay, <hi>Am I my Brothers Keeper?</hi> But be you of a contrary Spirit; if you ſee your Brother go in the Road to Hell, warn him, and by warning endeavour to ſtop him. If your Neighbours Houſe were on Fire at Midnight, and he himſelf faſt aſleep, oh, what pains would you take! How would you pull him out of his Bed, how loud would you cry, <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> to wake him! Alas, the ſinner with a ſecure Conſcience is in a far worſe caſe; he is faſt aſleep upon the brink of the burning Lake; and have you nothing to ſay to him? Oh, that you would put on Bowels, and ſpeak for Souls, and prevent their being loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>And becauſe your ſpeaking of it ſelf muſt needs be ineffectual, cry vehemently unto the Lord to Second you, and ſpeak with Mighty Power, <hi>Awake, awake, you that ſleep, and ariſe from the dead and live for ever.</hi> And let your Reproofs and Prayers be followed with ſuch an Holy, Harmleſs, Heavenly, Self-denying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as may tend unto their Conviction. If the Profane, if the Perſecuters, if Carnal Profeſſors had but a good Conſcience, it would be better for the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44406:145"/> Nation, better for the Church, better for particular Believers; and ah, how good would it be for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be very ſenſible <hi>that a good Conſcience is matter of the Devils Envy,</hi> therefore it concerns you to be Vigilant, for he will endeavour to wound it. Satan could behold the Rich Man in brave Apparel, and his Table ſumptuouſly Furniſhed, and tumbling in wealth and Pleaſures, and yet he did not Envy him; he knew that theſe things could not make him Happy, and would be ſo far from hindring, that they would rather further his eternal Miſery. But to ſee any with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, vexes and grieves the Devil; which as it ſhews that there is a great Excellency in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience above all Earthly good things, ſo it ſhould make you ſtand upon your Guard againſt this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>You muſt know, that although Grace cannot be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt, yet a good Conſcience may be both Defiled and Diſturbed. <hi>David</hi>'s ſin polluted him, therefore he prays to <hi>be waſhed throughly from his Iniquity,</hi> and to have his <hi>Heart cleanſed.</hi> His ſin alſo broke his Peace, therefore he Prays for the Light of God's Countenance, <hi>that the Bones which were broken might Rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 51. If you do not watch and pray, that you may not enter into Temptation, if you are not ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; if you do not put on the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil, up-upon a ſudden he may take Advantage, and draw you to ſome, perhaps, groſſer ſins; and this may make you to go in the bitterneſs of your Souls mourning to your Graves. If it had not been for his abominable fall, <hi>David</hi>'s latter part of his Life might have been
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44406:146"/> ſweeter; and, for ought I know, his Crown in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven brighter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be ſure <hi>with all keeping to keep the good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">

            <p>But be you more fixed, and better ſettled, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you loſe, keep a good Conſcience. And that you may do thus, follow theſe Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Vigorouſly maintain the Combat againſt Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Onely ſin can harm the Conſcience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrive againſt it. <hi>Abſtain from Fleſhly Luſts, for theſe War againſt your Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. Have a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44406:146"/> ſpecial Eye to in dwelling ſin, for that's a worſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by far than Satan; ſet upon the work of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in good earneſt, hide the Word in your hearts, that it may Antidote you againſt ſin: Derive Vertue from Chriſt Crucified, to Crucifie the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts of it, and call in the aid of the Spirit againſt the deeds of the Body. Conſcience will be kept in greater purity and Peace, the weaker ſin is, and the more it is an underling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sit looſe from the World.</hi> If <hi>Galeacius Carac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciolus</hi> had loved his Honour and great Eſtate in <hi>Italy,</hi> he would not have kept his Conſcience undefiled from <hi>Rome</hi>'s pollutions. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was good, profeſſes, that he Gloried <hi>in the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the World was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to him, and he unto the World,</hi> Gal. 6. 14. He looked upon the VVorld as a grand Impoſter: he ſaw no Form nor Comelineſs in it, that he ſhould deſire it; nay, he perceived how ſin had brought a Curſe upon it; no wonder if he ſlighted it. <hi>You cannot Serve God and Mammon.</hi> You muſt caſt the VVorld out of your Affections preſently, and conſent to let it go out of your Poſſeſſion too, when called to part withit, if you would keep a good Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Study the Vanity of Men, and be not afraid of them.</hi> The <hi>fear of Man bringeth a Snare,</hi> ſays <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Fear of the Papiſts made <hi>Spira</hi> wound his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and brought him into a fearful Caſe. <hi>Ceaſe ye</hi> therefore <hi>from Man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Iſa. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Be not afraid of the terror of your adverſaries, neither be troubled, but Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts in your hearts, let him be your fear, and let him be your dread, if you would ſecure your Conſciences.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:44406:147"/> 4. <hi>Pray much to be upheld.</hi> Commit the keeping of your Souls unto God in well doing, for he is Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Beg that he would never leave you, nor forſake you, but keep you by his Mighty Power unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not in vain to ſeek unto him, for <hi>he is of Power to eſtabliſh you,</hi> Rom. 16. 25. He is able to <hi>keep you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſs before the Preſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy,</hi> Jude 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Hold faſt Faith, that you may keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> firmly believe that Life and Immortality which is brought to light by the Goſpel, and then by patient continuance in well doing you will ſeek for it. The Lord grant unto you the Spirit of wiſdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, the eyes of your Underſtanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, that you may more thorowly and certainly know what is the hope of your Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of that Inheritance which is above; this will be a ſtrong inducement to keep Conſcience, and heart, and Converſation, and all clean, that you may grow more and more meet for that Inheritance. You ſee the way to keep a good Conſcience, which was the fourth word of Advice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You that have a good Conſcience <hi>be not Acted onely by Conſcience;</hi> but let Love <hi>(d)</hi> conſtrain you alſo to Obedience. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Titus, That he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Exhortation, but was more forward of his own accord,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 17.

I have lived</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>in good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God.</hi> Hark unto <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 168. <hi>All my wayes are before thee,</hi> and Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>I have the Lord alwayes before me. Job</hi> ſpeaks after the ſame manner, chap. 31. 4. <hi>Doth not God ſee my wayes and count all my ſteps?</hi> And <hi>Elijah</hi> ſpeaking of the Lord of hoſts, adds, <hi>before whom I ſtand,</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 18. 15. Theſe men had a great ſenſe of God upon their Spirits, &amp; ſo ſhould we; and a good Conſcience will ſtill be put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us in mind in whoſe preſence we continually are.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall firſt prove, that we are alwaies before God. Secondly, how we are to look upon God when we ſet our ſelves before him. Thirdly, what it is thus to ſet our ſelves before God. Fourthly, why a good Conſcience will make us to do thus. And fifthly, Apply.</p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:44406:148"/>
            <p> In the firſt place I am to prove, <hi>that we are alwaies before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeveral degrees of the preſence of God, the higheſt degree of all is his preſence with Chriſts humane Nature; a ſecond degree is his preſence with the Angels and triumphant Saints in his Kingdom and Glory, by whom he is ſeen face to face; a third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is his preſence vouchſafed unto his Saints Militant on Earth, whereby they are quickned, ſtrengthned, and abundantly incouraged. But beſides all this, there is a general preſence of God whereby he fills both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, ſo that nothing can be hid from him, Jer. 23. 24. <hi>Can any bide himſelf in ſecret places that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things are here to be remarked.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is ſo every where preſent as that <hi>he perfectly knows what is in us and done by us.</hi> He does poſſeſſe our very Reins, ſearches our very hearts, all the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſs will one day be brought to light, and the Counſels of mens hearts be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, 1 Cor. 4. 5. Though good works are done never ſo ſecretly, God ſees and will reward them openly; though wicked works are done never ſo cloſely, he ſees; and they ſhall be openly puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is ſo every where preſent, <hi>as that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually under his Power:</hi> the Pſalmiſt tell us, that <hi>his Kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Pſal. 103. 19. His Eyes run too and fro to ſhew himſelf ſtrong on the behalf of them whoſe hearts are perfect with him. And he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mighty to beat down and to deſtroy his Enemies, he can make deſtruction to come upon them like a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44406:148"/> Whirlewind, and though they may promiſe themſelves ſafety, yet they can in no wiſe ſecure themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Almighty hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God is every way preſent <hi>by his very Eſſence:</hi> oh the incomprehenſible immenſity of his being! <hi>He is not far,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>from every one of us,</hi> Act. 17. that is, he is really neer us, <hi>for in him we live, &amp; move, and have our being.</hi> 
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nos gentes nationeſque distinguimus; Deo una domus eſt mundus hic totus. Reges tantum regni ſui per officia miniſtrorum univerſa novére: Deo indiciis opus non eſt, non ſolum in oculis ejus ſed &amp; in ſinu vivimus. Cuncta deo plena ſunt.</hi> Minutius Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix p. <hi>mihi.</hi> 80.</note> You muſt not imagine that the Eſſence of God is divided, ſo as to be part in Earth and part in Heaven; but after an unconceivable manner, 'tis whole in it ſelf, whole in all things, whole in every thing, 'tis whole within all, whole without all, 'tis not mingled or defiled with any thing, 'tis no where includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no where excluded, nothing does or can contain it, and yet by it all things are contained: ſurely then this <hi>God does compaſſe our paths</hi> wherever we go, and <hi>is acquainted with all our wayes,</hi> Pſal. 139. 3.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place I am to ſhew you, <hi>how we are to look upon God</hi> when we ſet our ſelves before him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to look upon God as our <hi>Maker.</hi> 'Twas a complaint made by <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 35. 10. <hi>None ſaith, where is God my Maker?</hi> He is the former of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Father of our Spirits. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we are his off spring, and we ſhould be often enquiring
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44406:149"/> to what end he made us, which was that we might yeild fear, and ſervice, and love, and praiſe, to him that gave us our beings; and if we thwart the end of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſerve our luſts and Satan, who are our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Enemies, he may repent of making us, as he did concerning the old World, and then deſtruction will follow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to look upon God <hi>as our Owner.</hi> We are not our own; who can lay claim to us? Satan by right cannot, all that dominion that he has over us, is by uſurpation, and our being ſo fooliſh and wicked as to ſubject our ſelves voluntarily to him. But the Lord is by right our owner: to him we are debtors, and owe all that we have and are. We are not juſt unleſſe we yeild our ſelves to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are to look upon God as <hi>our Ruler.</hi> 'Twas a very prophane brag of thoſe, Pſal. 12. 4. <hi>Who is Lord over us?</hi> God ought to be acknowledged as our Lord; and if he be not obeyed as ſuch, he will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Lord by breaking us if we will not bow before him. We ſhould often be asking our ſelves, whoſe ſervants we are? if ſins, if Satans, we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound another queſtion, What wages theſe are likely to give us? and ſhould we toyl and work hard to make our ſelves miſerable, and bring our ſelves to Death and Hell?</p>
            <p>Onely the Lord has a right to rule us. We ſhould ſtill be enquiring what his will is; and ſince he is the ſupream Soveraign of Heaven and Earth, and is ſo Holy, Righteous, Gracious, his will ſhould never be thwarted by ours; but we ſhould endeavour to do it on Earth as 'tis done by thoſe in Heaven. There is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44406:149"/> abundant ſweetneſs at preſent in being not wedded to our own wills, in obeying the Lords will, beſides the future infinite recompence of reward, <hi>He that doth the will of God abideth for ever,</hi> 1 John. 2. 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we ſet our ſelves before God, we are to look upon him, <hi>as our preſerver.</hi> 'Tis of his Mercy that the Children of men are not conſumed, their provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are many but he being full of Compaſſion ſpares them. Our ſins have been crying out againſt us all our dayes, and Satan would fain have deſtroyed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured us long ago, but <hi>God is Rich in Goodneſs and forbearance,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. The Ox knows his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſter crib, and ſhall we never conſider to whom we are beholding? he is the God of our lives, and the Father of every Mercy which we receive; 'tis both our duty and intereſt to walk worthy of, and ſuitable unto his Care and Kindneſs, eſpecially if we are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: for then he is not only the Father of our Mercies, but our Father likewiſe, <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Falſa theologia eſt, Deum iratum eſſe agnoſcentibus peccata ſua: talis enim Deus nec in coelo nec uſquam est, ſed eſt idolum perverſi cordis quia verus Deus dicit, Nolo mortem peccatoris.</hi> Luther. Tom. 4. 383. <hi>a.</hi>
               </note> and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under our Fathers eye, <hi>we ſhould follow him as dear Children,</hi> Eph. 5. 1.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We are to look upon God, as <hi>Him who alone can make us happy.</hi> Sin cannot do it, for it has a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, how many millions has it undone and made miſerable for ever, and daily 'tis undoing more. The World cannot make us happy, for if the world had had power to do this, <hi>Solomon</hi> being exalted to the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44406:150"/> top of worldly greatneſs, and having ſo much of wealth and Earthly pleaſures that he could not deſire more; would not in the midſt of all have cryed out, <hi>all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of Spirit, and there is no profit under the Sun,</hi> Eccle. 2. 11.</p>
            <p>The Lord can ſatisfie the Soul of man though other things cannot. He can ſupply all our needs according to his Riches in Glory by Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. he can do more then our Souls can deſire or conceive, nay <hi>exceeding abundantly above all that we either ask or think.</hi> Let us be perſwaded that if ever we are happy God muſt make us ſo, and that he makes us happy no other way but by giving himſelf, and Communicating his Grace to us in his Son, and this will cauſe us to cleave unto him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We are to look upon God as <hi>one that is very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of us,</hi> leſt, we go a whoring after other Lovers, we are really idolaters if we love other things more than God, and Idolatry is Spiritual Adultery; and if Jealouſie be the rage of man, how much more is the Lords jealouſie to be feared? we ſhould call that Wife impudent with a witneſs, that ſhould commit lewdneſs before her Husbands face. Spiritual whoredom is never committed, but God looks on. Oh how daring are the Children of men! Think of Gods jealouſie when your hearts are about to depart from him, and to be taken ſo exceedingly with the things of the world. Hark to the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 10. 22. <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie, are we ſtronger than He?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. VVhen we ſet our ſelves before God, we are to look upon him <hi>as our Judge,</hi> and he will judge without reſpect of Perſons. He is an all-obſerving witneſs at
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44406:150"/> preſent, who is to be a Judg hereafter. He will bring every perſon and <hi>every work into Judgment, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil.</hi> Eccleſ. 12. ult. If this were ſeriouſly thought of 'twould make us fear him and keep his Commandements. Let us ſet our ſelves as before our Judge continually, then we ſhall be diligent that we may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blameleſs.</p>
            <p>In the third place I am to tell you what 'tis to ſet our ſelves before God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we indeed ſet our ſelves before God when we <hi>are firmly perſwaded of his preſence,</hi> and are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected. There is no attribute of God that we are leſſe able to deny, then his Omnipreſence, and yet how rarely are our hearts awed by it. VVe ſhould watch over our hearts and thoughts, and ſtrive againſt the vanity, and wickedneſs, and impertinency of theſe, as thoſe that are perſwaded we are before an Heart-ſearcher. <hi>Who knows our thoughts a farr off,</hi> Pſ. 139. 12.</p>
            <p>If there could not a proud, or luſtful, or fooliſh thought ariſe, but men might diſcern it; ſhould we not be aſhamed, and take more pains to keep our hearts clean? and is not the Lords preſence and knowledge more to be regarded then mans? in like manner we ſhould ſet a watch before the door of our Lips, and ponder the path of our Feet, becauſe <hi>there is not a word in our mouths, but God knows it altogether,</hi> and the <hi>wayes of man are before the Eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings,</hi> Prov. 5. 21.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:44406:151"/> 2. Then we ſet our ſelves before God, <hi>when we hear what he ſpeaks.</hi> Our Lord tells us, <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods words,</hi> John 8. 47. he has an Ear to hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches. And that Man after Gods own heart profeſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 161. <hi>My Heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> The Lord has a ſpecial regard unto them that tremble at his Word, who ſeriouſly enquire what his Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are, and dare not to tranſgreſs them: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they do contemn both the Lord and his Preſence, who, like thoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 17. <hi>Do hate Inſtruction, and caſt his Words behind them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Then we ſet our ſelves before God, <hi>when we Obſerve how he looks upon us,</hi> whether he frown, or cauſe his Face to ſhine. <hi>Jacob</hi> told his VVives, <hi>I ſee your Fathers Countenance is not towards me as before,</hi> Gen. 31. 5. And they who have a ſence of God upon their Spirits, if Gods Countenance be not towards them as before, how are they troubled! VVhen the Lord for a moment did hide his face from <hi>David,</hi> that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed an <hi>Age,</hi> nay, an <hi>Eternity;</hi> therefore he crys out, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy Face from me?</hi> Pſal. 13. 1. But when God did manifeſt himſelf to him, the Light of his Countenance did put a greater gladneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart, than the joy of Harveſt. VVe are not to regard what Men ſay of us, or how they look upon us, but we are to mind Gods approbation or diſlike. <hi>He is a Jew that is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the Heart, whoſe Praiſe is not of Men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Then we ſet our ſelves before God, <hi>when we take Notice what he does. David</hi> cemplains of, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44406:151"/> the ungodly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 4. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the Work of the Lord, nor the Operation of his Hand, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVe ſhould mind diligently what God does <hi>to us;</hi> that we may comply with his deſign in all, even the ſevereſt of his Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>VVhat he does <hi>for us;</hi> that his goodneſs may have an Holy and good effect upon us, and we may Anſwer his Loving kindneſs by Gratitude and Obedience.</p>
            <p>Finally, what he does <hi>to others before us;</hi> that we may receive <hi>Admonition</hi> by all the Examples that are given us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. Others Experience of the Lords faithfulneſs ſhould make us truſt in him; others Experience of the Lords ſeverity ſhould make us cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of provoking him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>Now, theſe things were our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not Luſt after evil things, as they alſo Luſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Then we ſet our ſelves before God, <hi>when we live by Faith upon him. David,</hi> when he ſet the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, becauſe he ſaw God at his right hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>He ſhould not be moved,</hi> Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>The Lord was his Rock, and his Fortreſs, and his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; his God, his Strength, in whom he was reſolved to truſt, his Buckler, and the Horn of his Salvation, and his high Tower,</hi> Pſal. 18. 2. He that Lives not by faith forgets God, and his heart draws back from him. But he that ſets the Lord before him, and conſiders his Promiſes and his power, cannot but look upon him as worthy to be relyed upon: and this is the way to be kept in perfect peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect Peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Then we ſet our ſelves before God, <hi>when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:44406:152"/> 
               <hi>Fellowſhip with him.</hi> This fellowſhip is a Riddle to the VVorld, but the Saints find it a moſt real happineſs. VVe are to ſet our ſelves before the Lord, as weak, and indigent, and miſerable; and to implore the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his favour in his dear Son, and that he would communicate his Grace for the ſtrengthning of us with ſtrength in our Souls, and the ſupply of all our wants. VVho can indeed look upon God, and not deſire to taſte and ſee how Gracious he is? <hi>David</hi> followed hard after him, and crys out, <hi>My Soul thirſteth for God, for the Living God; when ſhall I come and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God? Pſal.</hi> 42. 2.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Then we ſet the Lord before us, <hi>when we refer all unto his Glory;</hi> when we aim at this as our great End, that he may be Magnified and Exalted. We wofully forget God when we ſeek our ſelves and our own things; when we chiefly deſign our own praiſe and Profit. Set him indeed before you, and then his Honour, and the enjoyment of him, will be the great Mark you will aim at; and indeed his Honour and your Happineſs are joyned together, that you cannot ſeek his Honour, but you muſt alſo at the ſame time ſeek your own Happineſs; and you cannot do any thing to his Diſhonour, but 'tis alſo to your ſelves deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, I am to give you the Reaſon, why a good Conſcience makes Men to ſet themſelves thus before God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not to ſet our ſelves before God, <hi>is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Affront him:</hi> If we were in the Preſence of an Earthly King, and ſhould take no more Notice of him,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44406:152"/> or not ſo much Notice of him as of another Man, ſurely he would ill reſent it. God is the King of Glory, and if his Preſence is not regarded, we make no more of him than if he were an Idol, which has Eyes, but ſees not; Ears, but hears not; and in whoſe power 'tis not to do either good or evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not to ſet our ſelves before God, is <hi>to thwart the End that he aims at, both in his Word and Works.</hi> His Works are many and great, that we might ſtand in awe of the Worker; and in his Word he has told us what a God he is, that we might fear before him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſet our ſelves before God, is the way <hi>to keep up the Authority of Conſcience;</hi> the Word in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences Mouth will be more heeded, when our Eyes are open to look upon that Holy and Powerful God, whoſe Officer Conſcience is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To ſet our ſelves before God, is <hi>both for our Delight and Advantage:</hi> The Preſence of God is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible indeed to the evil Conſcience; but thoſe whoſe hearts are cleanſed, are glad that the Lord is ever with them. VVith what ſatisfaction and Triumph did the Church ſpeak thoſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 7. 11. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us, the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our Refuge, Selah.</hi> And the profit which we reap from a ſence of this Preſence, is very great; for when we hear, and pray, and perform other Duties, as in the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then they turn to good Account; but when God is not regarded, to be ſure, we are not at all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged; nay, our very Duties do but increaſe our guilt and hardneſs.</p>
            <pb n="288" facs="tcp:44406:153"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>

            <p n="1">1. How are they to be blamed, who inſtead of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves before God, <hi>Baniſh the thoughts of him, and Live without him in the World!</hi> This forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God is <hi>the Root of preſumption</hi> and boldneſs in ſin, when there is no ſenſe or fear of the Lords Eye or Hand, then the hearts of the Sons of Men will be be fully ſet in them to do evil.

               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:44406:154"/> 
               <hi>Vanity,</hi> compared with the All-ſufficient God. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when his Eye was cleared, and he ſaw God, no longer Admired the Proſperity of the wicked, but ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none on Earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73. 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will make you to <hi>have an eye to your Hearts,</hi> becauſe God looks into, and requires theſe; and to be more Spiritual and Lively in all your Duties, and more generally to pleaſe him in all your Actions. VVhen you conſider ſeriouſly, that <hi>He does beſet you behind and before, and does lay his Hand upon you,</hi> Pſal. 139. 5. You will be afraid to provoke him, leſt that Hand do cruſh you in the very act of the next Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you ſet your ſelves before God, this will make you <hi>to be the better contented when outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are taken from you.</hi> Outward Comforts may be rejoyced in, but for Gods ſake; God is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in for his own ſake. And his goodneſs and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being ſtill the ſame, he is as much to be delighted in when the Creatures are gone, as when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>When the Figg-trees did not bloſſom, and there was no Fruit in the Vines;</hi> yet the Prophet ſayes, <hi>I will Joy in the Lord, and Rejoyce in the God of my Salvation,</hi> Hab. 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This will make you <hi>Fearleſs of Men, nay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted in the hour of your Diſſolution:</hi> VVhen you are in the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, you will fear no evil as long as you ſee that God is with you; and Death will be ſo far from ſeparating you from his Preſence, or from his Love, that 'twill ſend you nearer to him than ever, and admit you to a fuller enjoyment
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44406:154"/> of him, than can be vouchſafed to any under the Sun. Thus of that third Doctrine, <hi>A good Conſcience makes men to ſet themſelves before God continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The Fourth Doctrine is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a good Conſcience has a great and laſting influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the life and all the Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have <hi>lived</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, in <hi>all</hi> good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that <hi>unto this day,</hi> ſo Heb. 13. 18. <hi>We truſt we have a good Conſcience in all things willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</hi> Such a Conſcience is well inſtructed in that leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Tit. 2. 11. 12. <hi>For the Grace of God which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, and Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall firſt ſhew how a good Conſcience is concerned in the Life and Converſation. Secondly, Inſtance in ſeveral kinds of Actions, that a good Conſcience has an influence upon. Laſtly, Conclude with the Application.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I am to ſhew how a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is concerned in the Life and Converſation. This will appear in theſe following particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is <hi>no action but Conſcience is to examine.</hi> Every action is a ſtep one way or other, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to ſee which way every ſtep has a tendency, whether upward towards the Hill of the Lord, or downward towards the lake of Fire.</p>
            <pb n="292" facs="tcp:44406:155"/>
            <p> There is no action but Conſcience will be wounded with it, if it be a work of darkneſs, and Conſcience may reap ſatisfaction from it, if it be a work of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience if good, <hi>will not admit of looſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not argue licentiouſly from the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which alone is imputed to us for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that therefore there is no neceſſity of inherent Holyneſs.</p>
            <p>It will not argue from the ſuperabundant Grace of God that therefore we may ſafely continue in ſin, Rom. 6. 15, 16. <hi>What then, ſhall we ſin becauſe we are not under the Law but under Grace? God forbid, Know ye not that to whom ye yeild your ſelves Servants to obey, his Servants ye are to whom you obey, whether of ſin unto Death, or obedience unto Righteouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A good Conſcience will not argue from the falls of Saints recorded in Scripture, that we may venture to fall as they did; but contrarily concludes ſince ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Saints have fallen, it does concern us to look to our ſtanding, and not to be high minded but fear.</p>
            <p>Finally, it does not argue becauſe Gods Covenant is Everlaſting, and his love unchangeable, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may live as we liſt; but on the contrary it tells us that becauſe the Lords love is ſo great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, he is to be loved the more by us, and followed more fully, and more willingly obeyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſcience if good, <hi>will not abuſe Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nature of this is not to be miſtaken, 'tis not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make proviſion for the Fleſh, nor to walk after
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44406:155"/> the courſe of the World, nor to miſpend your precious time, nor to omit, or do the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. They that take ſuch a liberty take that which God never gave them, and by this liberty they become ſlaves and vaſſals to the Devil who employes and leads them captive at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But Chriſtian liberty lies in being free from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Corruption, from the Curſe of the Law, and the Power of Darkneſs, and in having freedom of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to God through Chriſt, and in being enlarged by the Spirit to run the wayes of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian liberty is an holy thing. A good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence therefore is the more watchful, leſt we go beyond the bounds of Chriſtian liberty, and venture upon what is unlawful, or uſe lawful things unlawfully; for ſo 'tis poſſible, nay uſual, <hi>licitis perire</hi> even in theſe things to periſh. <hi>To Eat, to Drink, to Buy to Sell, to Plant, to Build, to Marry and to be given in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> were none of them in themſelves unlawful, yet when the old world, and <hi>Sodom</hi> were thus employed, and theſe things were only minded, and ſpiritual things neglected, a Flood came and ſwept away the one; and Fire and Brimſtone did deſtroy the other, Luk. 17. 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A good Conſcience looks well <hi>to the Principles of our Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it ſprings from a renewed nature, for unleſs we are made good Trees, how can we bring forth good Fruit? that it proceeds from Faith, for by Faith we muſt believe what we do to be according to the will of God, and by Faith we muſt deſire ſtrength from our Lord Jeſus to do that will which is diſcovered to us.</p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:44406:156"/>
            <p> Our Obedience alſo muſt flow from love, 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us to love, not unto our ſelves but unto him that died for us.</hi> Love is the firſt and great Command, and that which makes us to yeild obedience to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And we muſt be acted by Fear as well as Love, a childlike reverence and awe of God, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly will it make us walk! <hi>Job feared God and eſchewed evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally. our Obedience muſt ſpring from gratitude, and a ſenſe of our obligation to ſerve the Lord who hath ſo loaded us with innumerable benefits. All the mercies and deliverances which God did work for, and extend to <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to induce them <hi>to obſerve his Statutes and to keep his Laws.</hi> Pſal. 105. 45.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A good Conſcience has a <hi>regard unto the matter of our actions.</hi> That this be agreeable unto the Word of God. This word is the rule we are to walk by; that peace and mercy may be upon us.</p>
            <p>There is a word which God will do, his word of Promiſe he will accompliſh, his word of Threatning he will execute; and his word of Prophecy he will fulfill.</p>
            <p>There is a word which he will have us to do, and thats the word of Precept. A good Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the precepts of the Law, the ſum of which is <hi>to Love the Lord with all our Heart, and Soul, and Mind, and Strength, and our Neighbour as our Selves, Mat.</hi> 22. 37. 39. This Law is not made void but eſtabliſh'd by Faith, even in the Covenant of Grace the Lord promiſes to write this Law in our Hearts, and ſayes he will put his ſpirit within us, to cauſe us to walk in his Statutes, and to obſerve his Judgements, and do them.</p>
            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:44406:156"/>
            <p> The Goſpel has precepts alſo as well as the Law, which a good Conſcience knowes are to be obeyed. And if we will indeed obey the Goſpel, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Jeſus, we muſt repent from dead works, we muſt live by Faith, we muſt give all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure, we muſt love our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as love is a new command, and enjoyned upon a new motive, namely the great love of Chriſt. We muſt engage in all the Ordinances and Inſtitutions of our Lord Jeſus; finally, we muſt hold faſt our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion without wavering whatever troubles upon that ſcore do overtake us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A good Conſcience <hi>Eyes the Manner of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> That it be out of choice. <hi>David</hi> did <hi>chuſe the way of the Lords Precepts,</hi> he conſidered theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, eſteemed them concerning all things to be right, and preferred them before all the Falſe and deſtructive wayes of ſin.</p>
            <p>Obedience muſt not only be out of choice, but it muſt be univerſal in regard of the <hi>object,</hi> all the commands be reſpected, and in regard of the <hi>Subject,</hi> the whole man muſt be under obedience; and as this obedience muſt be yeilded to God without delay, ſo we muſt be ſure to ſtick unto his teſtimonies and perſevere unto the end. <hi>If ye continue in my word</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>then are ye my Diſciples indeed,</hi> John 8. 31.</p>
            <p>But after we have done our beſt and moſt, we muſt humbly and believingly look unto Jeſus, for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of our imperfections, and that we and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances may be accepted.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A good Conſcience looks <hi>to the End of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and that the deſign of our actions be as it ought. And our end ſhould be not onely the obtaining of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44406:157"/> but the Glory of God, John 15. 8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much Fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples,</hi> we ſhould aim alſo at the credit and adorning of the Goſpel, and the good of men. Good living is for the benefit of others in more regards than one. Men are benefited by our good works of Juſtice and Mercy, and ſuch like, and our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe works may help to convince them that there is an excellency and efficacy in the Goſpel, which brings forth Fruits that be ſo excellent. You ſee how a good Conſcience is concerned in the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, I am to inſtance in ſeveral kinds of actions which a good Conſcience has an influence upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A good Conſcience has an influence <hi>upon our holy duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not ſatisfied unleſs we begin the day with theſe; God ſhould have our firſt thoughts, and our affections and praiſes ſhould be our morning ſacrifice. <hi>In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhould direct our prayer unto him, and look up,</hi> Pſ. 5. 1, 2, 3. The Scriptures are to be ſearched that our Hearts may be inſtructed, quickened, purified, ſtrengthned, and revived by this word of Grace.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience will not ſuffer holy duties to be done negligently; it knows how treacherous the heart is, and therefore watches over it that it may engage in the Lords ſervice, and not ſtart aſide like a deceitful bow.</p>
            <pb n="297" facs="tcp:44406:157"/>
            <p>
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non venitur ad bonam conſcientiam niſi per cordis custodiam; Cor ad vitam ſe vertit aut ad mortem; velle peccare malum, pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care pejus, in peccato perſever are peſſimum; nolle poenitere, mortale.</hi> Bernard. <hi>de Interior. dom.</hi> cap. 24.</note> Conſcience will not be put off with words, that are good or with a bended knee, or a lifted up Eye, or a ſigh now and then, but looks that Holy deſires be ſtrong and ſtirring, that Faith be acted upon the promiſes of God, who is ſo ready <hi>to be found of them that ſeek him with their whole Heart.</hi> Deut. 4. 29.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience looks upon holy duties as things of grand concernment, if theſe are well done it will be well with us, if ill done, it will be ill with us for ever. In your Trades you are getting a livelihood, but in your duties you are or ſhould be minding a better and enduring ſubſtance. What does deſerve your pains and time, and ſerious endeavours, if the favour of God, and the fulneſs of Chriſt, and an Heavenly Kingdom do not? what manner of duties ſhould ours be, ſince we aim at ſuch things in the doing of them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. A good Conſcience has an influence <hi>upon the works of our Callings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not allow of an unlawful Calling; and that is to be ſtyled an unlawful Calling, in which a livelihood is gotten by ſerving and gratifying the luſts of men. The Harlots way is unlawful, and Stage-players is little better. 'Tis a wicked thing to live by the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by helping to undo and ruine them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <pb n="298" facs="tcp:44406:158"/>
            <p> And as the Calling muſt be Lawful, ſo it muſt be Lawfully managed. A good Conſcience will take care that there be not an over eagerneſs after wealth, which is of a periſhing Nature; for <hi>the time is ſhort,</hi> and therefore <hi>they that Buy, muſt be as though they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this World, as not abuſing of it, for the Faſhion of this World paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>And as for unjuſt and diſhoneſt gain, a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can by no means allow it. <hi>Do Juſtly,</hi> is a Law ſo deeply engraven in the heart of Men by Nature, and ſo often required in the Scripture, that where injuſtice is, we may conclude there is no goodneſs or tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Conſcience. <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bona conſcientia est, ſi habet in corde puritatem, in ore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem; in actione rectitudinem.</hi> Bernard. <hi>De Conſcien.</hi> cap. 4. pag. <hi>mihi</hi> 1099.</note> VVhen this is indeed awakened, though other ſins do flie in the ſinners face, yet if any thing has been gotten wrongfully, this in a ſpecial manner is a burthen, neither is there any reſt till Reſtitution be made, either to the Perſon wronged, or if he cannot be found, unto the poor. That Scripture ſhould ever be Ringing in our ears, in all Trading and Buſineſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>That no Man go beyond or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Brother in any matter, becauſe the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not onely Injuſtice, but Idleneſs in the Calling is to be ſhunned: for this Idleneſs is the way to cloath a Man with Rags, and expoſes to innumerable temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <note n="(g)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tis a good anſwer to the tempter.</hi> Non licet, non vacat, <hi>'Tis not lawfull, neither am I at leiſure to do what thou wouldſt have me.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:44406:158"/> 3. A good Conſcience has an Influence <hi>upon our Words and Diſcourſes:</hi> for a great part of <hi>Pure and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled Religion does lie in brideling of the Tongue,</hi> James 1. 26. Our Communication ſhould be ſuch as may adminiſter Grace unto the Hearers.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience will not admit of <hi>Impiety</hi> in our Diſcourſe, and certainly Oaths and Curſes are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. Leſſer Oaths are not to be ſworn, but greater; as by the God of Heaven, the Blood and wounds of the Lord Jeſus, argue ſinners to be daring; and how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is it to hear them calling upon God to damn them! Such things Argue that there is no good Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Neither will this admit of <hi>Impurity</hi> in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; for <hi>filthy and fooliſh talking</hi> is condemned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. and is a ſign of a corrupt and unrenewed heart, out of the abundance of which the mouth ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>Finally, a good Conſcience will not ſuffer us to be <hi>Injurious</hi> to any in our Diſcourſes; by Defaming, by Back-biting, by Slandering of them. Thoſe that take up Reproaches againſt their Neighbours, and ſpread them; their own mouths condemn them, and plainly prove that they are not Citizens of <hi>Zion, Pſal.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A good Conſcience has an Influence <hi>upon our Time, that it may be well and wiſely Husbanded:</hi> This is more precious than Gold that periſhes, and if the Goldſmith does look upon all gold as worth ſaving, ſurely every moment of Time is worth Redeeming.</p>
            <p>That which makes other things of leſs value, namely, the ſhortneſs of their continuance, makes Time of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er value: 'Tis the more to be prized, becauſe 'twill ſo quickly be at an end. A good Conſcience will make us <hi>paſs the time of our Sojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17. It will not allow any time to ſin (though indeed
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44406:159"/> ſin will be apt to ſteal time away.) It will not allow the VVorld to ingroſſe all our time, but 'twill be Liberal of time, that the Soul and Eternity may be provided for.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A good Cnoſcience has an influence <hi>upon our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Actions;</hi> as Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It takes care that there be not exceſs in theſe: If we Eat to Gluttony, and Drink to Drunkenneſs, we are rather Beaſts than Men, and ſurely far from being Saints: And if we ſleep too much, we ſeem to lie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all that while, and while too much in our Beds, we are but unprofitable Burthens of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And as Exceſſe in theſe Actions is avoided by a good Conſcience, ſo the glory of God is the End unto which they are Directed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. A good Conſcience has an Influence upon <hi>your Recreations.</hi> You muſt not, ſays Conſcience, be Prodigal of your Eſtates, nor of your time in theſe: You muſt not needleſly torment, and be cruel to the Creatures which groan ſufficiently already under the ſin of Man; you muſt take heed of Paſſion in your Recreations. A good Conſcience will put us in mind that we muſt Recreate our ſelves, that we may be more fit for buſineſs; if therefore Recreations juſtle out Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or indiſpoſe us to it, the End of them is not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>I might alſo add, that a good Conſcience will take Notice of our garb; and if you will but hearken to it, it will tell you plainly, <hi>That Men and Women Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Godlineſs, ſhould not go in ſuch kind of gay Attire,</hi>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:44406:159"/> 
               <hi>as the Rogues and Ranters, and Whores of the Town wear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. A good Conſcience will have an Influence upon <hi>your Carriage in your Relations.</hi> All Relations call for Duty, and unleſs we do our Duty, and are good in our Relations, we cannot be ſaid to be good in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The great Fundamental Relation is between Man and Wife. A good Conſcience therefore will take care that theſe Yoke-fellows come together in an Holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; it will not allow of Inceſt, or Marrying within for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden degrees; no force muſt be uſed, nor marrying contrary to the conſent of Parents, nor muſt a Believer be unequally Yoaked with one that's none, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. For if the Family at firſt be not piouſly erected, God may be ſo much provoked, that it may Labour and Travel under the Burthen of his Anger ever after.</p>
            <p>A good Conſcience will make the Husband, Loving, Careful, Tender of his Wives Perſon, and eſpecially of her Soul. A good Conſcience will make the Wife Affectionate, Faithful, to Reverence her Husband, and to be Subject to him in every thing. A good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will make Parents to bring up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; and 'twill make Children to Honour, and to Obey their Parents, and to be a ſupport, and a Comfort to them. A good Conſcience will make Maſters to give unto their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that which is Juſt and Equal, conſidering they have a Maſter in Heaven, with whom there is no reſpect of Perſons: and 'twill make Servants with good will to do Service as unto the Lord, and not unto Men; it will ſtop their mouths when about to Anſwer again, it will make them diligent, and to ſhew all good Fidelity,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44406:160"/> that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Depart from Evil.</hi> There cannot poſſibly be a greater Evil than Sin; this is the procuring Cauſe of all other evils: there had never been any ſuch thing as Sickneſs, Pain, Death, Hell, if Sin had never been. Sin dos <hi>alienate</hi> from God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. 'Tis a moſt baſe Employment, we cannot be engaged in fouler and

No, no, the works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are Unfruitfull. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe works whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> All will repent of theſe evil works ſooner or later; the ſooner the better: for to repent in Hell will be too late.</p>
            <p>Mind therefore your Conſciences bidding you ceaſe to do Evil, elſe Evil will be extremely aggravated: But if Evil be forſaken, the great Bar to Mercy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and God is ready to pardon and be at peace with you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Learn to do well.</hi> Conſcience will be pleaſed if God be pleaſed; God is a Gracious Lord, compare Him and Sin together, Him and Satan together. His Commands are not grievous, he is ready to help you to do whatever he requires, and to work all your works in you and for you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. Your work, if truely good, will be wages, becauſe of that Peace and Joy at preſent to be found in the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: for by good works it appears that Faith is of the right kind; is the Faith of Gods Elect.</p>
            <p>Finally you muſt be judged according to your VVorks. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be.</hi> As you would ſtand at that day, up and be doing the work of the Lord now.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The fifth Doctrine is this: <hi>A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſteels a mans Heart with courage, and makes</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:44406:162"/> 
               <hi>him fearleſs before his Enemies.</hi> Paul <hi>earneſtly beheld the Councel:</hi> He was not afraid to face them, becauſe his Conſcience was clear. Nay, we read that <hi>Foelix</hi> the <hi>Judge trembled,</hi> while <hi>Paul</hi> the Priſoner was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident:</hi> the reaſon was, becauſe the Judge had a bad Conſcience, which flew in his face when <hi>he heard of Righteouſneſs, Temperance and Judgement to come,</hi> Act. 24. 25. but the Priſoner being acquitted by a good Conſcience, did not tremble but rejoyce at the thoughts of Judgement to come. VVhen <hi>Bradford</hi> was brought before the Chancellour, he thought to brow-beat him, but could not; <hi>Bradford</hi> look'd him ſteadfaſtly in the Face, and out-look'd him, and then look'd up to Heaven: I do not wonder that he did not fear the the Look of a Popiſh Biſhop, who was not afraid (as it appeared afterwards) of a fiery Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</p>
            <p>Now the grounds why thoſe that have a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are Fearleſs, be theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Strength of God who is engaged for them, is everlaſting.</hi> Iſa. 26. 4. <hi>In the Lord Jehovah is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As his Strength, ſo <hi>his Covenant and Kindneſs are alſo everlaſting.</hi> Iſa. 54. 10. <hi>For the Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills be removed, but my Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall not depart from thee, nor the Covenant of my Peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy upon thee.</hi> Nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate Believers from the <hi>Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let the <hi>weakneſs of Enemies</hi> be conſidered. Why ſhould he that has a good Conſcience be afraid
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:44406:162"/> of a Man that ſhall die, and of the Son of man that ſhall be made as Graſs?</p>
            <p n="4">4. As Enemies are weak, ſo they are <hi>limited;</hi> they are abſolutely under Gods Power, they are as a ſtaffe in his hand, and cannot move or ſtrike but as he pleaſes. <hi>Let not the Axe boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth therewith:</hi> Iſa. 10. 15. Why ſhould a good Conſcience be afraid of the Axe, ſince the Lord (in whoſe hand the Axe is,) is ſo ſure and great a Friend?</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is an excellent Promiſe, That what Men do <hi>mean for Evil,</hi> ſhall <hi>turn to Good:</hi> Nay, <hi>all all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God</hi> Rom. 8. 28.

Of Terrour to Believers Adverſaries; There is very good reaſon why Fear ſhould ſeize upon them: they are engaged in bad work, they have a bad Conſcience, and their End if they go on in this way they are in, will be a bad End.

               <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. <hi>Thoſe that are truely Conſcientious love their Enemies, and wiſh them no worſe than if they were their Brethren.</hi> This is the ſixth and laſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Men and Brethren.</hi> The Reaſons of this Doctrine are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Command is expreſs and plain, <hi>to love Enemies.</hi> Mat. 5. 44. <hi>But I ſay to you, love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe who now have a good Conſcience, <hi>were once Enemies, and yet they were loved;</hi> though now
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44406:163"/> the Children of God, yet there was a time <hi>that they were the Children of wrath even as others,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. <hi>Though now they have obtained Mercy, yet there was a time wherein they had not obtained mercy.</hi> They ſhould compaſſionate Enemies, ſince Divine Compaſſion was ſhewed to them even when they were Enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Enemies may be converted, and become Friends to God and to his People. Stephen</hi> had a Love to his Enemies when Stoning him to death, and prayes for them: his Prayer was heard, and <hi>Saul</hi> that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to his death, was afterwards converted, and became an Apoſtle, and laboured more abundantly than all the Apoſtles, to ſpread the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Enemies are loved, there is <hi>great Peace and Sweetneſs in ſuch a temper:</hi> this is a great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Sincerity, and the Heart is emptied of that Malice, Envy, Revenge, which are greatly torturing as well as very ſinfull.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To Love Enemies, makes us <hi>very like unto our Heavenly Father,</hi> for he is <hi>kind unto the unthankfull and to the evil;</hi> he <hi>makes his Sun to ſhine upon the evil and upon the good, and ſends Rain upon the juſt and upon the unjuſt,</hi> Mat. 5. 45.</p>
            <p>The Uſe that I ſhall make of this Doctrine, ſhall be in theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Conſcientious love their <hi>Enemies,</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will much more love their <hi>Brethren.</hi> How much is Love called for in the Goſpel! what Motives
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44406:164"/> are uſed to perſwade to it! 'Tis the Mark upon the Sheep of Chriſt, that they <hi>love one another;</hi> and <hi>He that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>ſo little love,</hi> we may conclude <hi>there is but little Conſcience.</hi> 
               <note n="(†)" place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. To revive Conſcience is <hi>the way to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace.</hi> 'Tis ſad to ſee the Members of Chriſt at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance among themſelves.

'tis a ſign there is little of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Conſcience if good, is an Enemy to Strife and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; 'tis againſt perverſe Diſputing, and that Pride and Paſſion and Selfiſhneſs with which thoſe Diſputes are managed.

Bid them take heed of Lying and Stealing, and truſting in any ſinful courſe for a Livelihood, but perſwade them to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, that all other things which are needful may be added to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
               <p>Charge them to be Poor in Spirit, to be contented with their Condition without murmuring againſt God, or envying at thoſe who have more than themſelves; and above all things to endeovour that they may be rich towards God; <hi>Rich in Faith, and then they will be Heirs of the Kingdom, which the Lord has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that Love him,</hi> James 2. 5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. O Conſcience, ſpeak unto <hi>Traders of all ſorts,</hi> tell them, that falſe Weights, and Meaſures, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances are an abomination in the ſight of God. When they are about to Cheat, give them a check, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them that an Eſtate gotten by fraud is attended with a Curſe.</p>
               <p>Be with them in their Shops, and at the Exchange, obſerve how they Buy and Sell, and examine all their gains; bid them to mete the ſame meaſure unto others, that they would have mete unto themſelves; and <hi>to do as they would be done unto,</hi> Mat. 7. 12.</p>
               <p>Tell them that 'tis the height of Madneſs to venture the loſing of their Souls for a pound, or for a ſhilling, or for Six-pence unjuſtly gained, ſince Chriſt, who knew the value of Souls, ſays, that a Soul is more worth than the World, and all the Wealth of it put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <p>Call them Dogs for returning to their Vomit, and Swine, for wallowing again in their former Mire. Tell them that where there was but one unclean Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are likely to be poſſeſſed with ſeven now; and the latter end will be worſe with them than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the Sons of Peace, and therefore let thy Peace, and thy Lords Peace come and abide upon them. <note n="(m)" place="margin">

Practice not the ſins thou cryeſt out againſt, neglect not the Duties thou urgeſt others to perform. Be not like thoſe who dig in Mines, and enrich others, but are poor themſelves: Or like that Statue in <hi>Greece,</hi> which ſhewed the way to <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> but it ſelf ſtirred not. Oh, take heed, leſt after thou haſt Preached Chriſt and Conſcience unto others, thou thy ſelf be found a caſt-away.</p>
